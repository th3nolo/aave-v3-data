From the Reserve, GHO is distributed through independent channels, each with its own governance-controlled add cap, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lending Credit Lines</strong> to Prime, Aave-aligned Hub, Ethena, EtherFi, and Neobank Hubs, making GHO available for borrowing within each Hub\u2019s Spokes.</li>\n<li><strong>stataUSDC GSM</strong> and <strong>stataUSDT GSM</strong> for peg stability through direct swap mechanisms that are separate from the liquidity markets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each channel operates independently, so governance can scale GHO supply into high-demand Hubs while keeping tighter limits on newer environments without one affecting the capacity of another.</p>\n<p>Gho Stewards interact exclusively via the Credit Line funded by the Gho Reserve, with the Add Cap acting as the primary constraint on GHO expansion. This mirrors the economic role of the Gho Facilitator in Aave v3, where capacity is managed at the reserve level while the Add Cap replaces the Borrow Cap as the control on total GHO exposure. Governance and Gho Stewards retain direct authority over system growth through Credit Line adjustments.</p>\n<p>With each channel having its own cap and operating in a distinct market environment, governance can also <strong>choose precisely which collateral/risk profiles support incremental GHO supply</strong> (i.e., the <em>asset exposure</em> the protocol takes). This allows Aave to scale GHO where the underlying collateral and liquidation conditions are most trusted, while limiting exposure to newer or riskier setups.</p>\n<p>Separating stablecoin liquidity across distinct capped channels provides granular control over liquidity composition, liquidation behaviour, and surplus generation, while isolating each Spoke from broader Core market risk, allowing the Core market to provide a secondary-market savings option that complements sGHO, which has a suitably lower risk profile.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-prime-hub-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-prime-hub-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Concept - Prime Hub</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d222a41eeb7a9d743aa5570eacdd2a3dfdea61ff.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/tYWuc2bKw4Bly4HPRPigyfXmzjV.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d222a41eeb7a9d743aa5570eacdd2a3dfdea61ff.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"tYWuc2bKw4Bly4HPRPigyfXmzjV\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The Prime Hub best represents a more Senior market, characterised by isolated lending pools with tighter risk controls. Whilst a simple, isolated market structure can be created, the example above highlights how the Reinvestment feature could provide a distinct advantage relative to other markets. There are a few options for allocating the excess capital; one possibility is Simple Earn on Coinbase, or, to minimise counterparty risk, an allocation to a suitably low-risk Hub-and-Spoke, such as the Coinbase Hub-and-Spoke shown later. Creating such a market in which the supply yield always exceeds that of T-bills would be a welcome improvement relative to the current market, where supply rates are well below T-bill yields. The intention for this market is to limit collateral types to those with the lowest complexity, such as fiat-redeemable stablecoins and the most dominant BTC wrapper products.</p>\n<p>The graphic shows Lido\u2019s wstETH, the most dominant Liquid Staking Token (LST) with widespread adoption, as yield-generating collateral with the Max. Lido Yield Spoke is configured to support leverage yield strategies such as the stVault product. By isolating LST and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT) across the Hubs-and-Spoke, for example, Core and Prime, the market can price the risk associated with each collateral type. This also allows the cost of borrowing ETH to be market-determined without the need for directional/opinionated use of the Risk Premium between LRT and LSTs.</p>\n<p>Note: Lido\u2019s wstETH is used as an example, and other suitable LSTs may be included.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-core-hub-with-a-reinvestment-feature-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-core-hub-with-a-reinvestment-feature-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Concept - Core Hub with a Reinvestment Feature</strong></h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a94a9634794a5ce5bb0abce21b3e620f71b3a6a5.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/o9CuCnAbTv2mAnFGQstud52mIg5.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a94a9634794a5ce5bb0abce21b3e620f71b3a6a5.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"o9CuCnAbTv2mAnFGQstud52mIg5\" width=\"1647\" height=\"1400\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The Core market presented above is risk-adjusted and favours yield-generating collateral types, capital efficiency, and the creation of passive yield for the user, most similar to the existing Core market on Ethereum, with specialised Spokes, Draw Caps, and Add Caps used to limit asset exposure.</p>\n<p>Aave v4 expands the DAO\u2019s ability to express liquidity and risk policy at the system level, rather than having outcomes emerge solely as a by-product of utilisation dynamics. Idle stablecoin liquidity in the Core Hub is no longer structurally constrained to lower productivity; it can be allocated, within governance-defined bounds, into highly liquid, low-risk instruments, thereby establishing a baseline return profile for idle capital.</p>\n<p>This approach enhances capital efficiency without altering the protocol\u2019s liquidity assurances. By allowing a portion of idle capital to remain productive within governance-defined constraints, v4 supports a more stable return profile than prior versions, translating design flexibility into measured economic benefits at the protocol level.</p>\n<p><strong>Reinvestment Feature</strong></p>\n<p>Stablecoins sitting idle in the Core Hub (not currently borrowed by any Spoke) are put to work. A reinvestment controller routes them into yield strategies such as sUSDS to earn the Sky Savings Rate, Coinbase\u2019s Simple Earn, and potentially highly liquid RWAs. At scale, the reinvestment feature can behave like a portfolio to balance duration schedules and target a specific yield profile.</p>\n<p>The Core Hub also extends credit lines to other Hubs (Aave-aligned, EtherFi, Ethena). When borrowing demand increases, reinvested capital from yield strategies is immediately withdrawn and made available. The interest rate model accounts for the amount of reinvestment, so rates adjust accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks and considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Bad debt on any Spoke is shared across all Hub suppliers. Draw Caps are the primary safeguard, bounding maximum loss per Spoke. Reinvestment is only safe with instant-redeem strategies. If too much idle capital is reinvested and multiple Spokes spike utilisation simultaneously, there may not be enough instant liquidity to serve all withdrawals and borrows at once.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-neobank-configuration-etherfi-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-neobank-configuration-etherfi-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Concept  -  Neobank Configuration (EtherFi)</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d8011b62eaa286599e802f448ad19fb73b854881.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uORvkoIxpmR0ZeSw0tGQpofQT8B.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470875-y\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d8011b62eaa286599e802f448ad19fb73b854881.jpeg\" alt=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470875-y\" data-base62-sha1=\"uORvkoIxpmR0ZeSw0tGQpofQT8B\" width=\"1280\" height=\"704\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This configuration places a dedicated EtherFi Hub at the centre of a Neobank use case, in which users deposit weETH as collateral and borrow stablecoins that are loaded onto an EtherFi Pay card. weETH continues to earn restaking yield while serving as collateral, thereby allowing users maintain ETH exposure and staking returns while accessing stablecoin liquidity.</p>\n<p>Stablecoin liquidity enters the Hub through two paths. USDC and USDT are sourced from the Core Hub via a stablecoin credit line. GHO enters from the GHO Reserve through a GHO Credit Line with a defined Add Cap, acting as a backstop, ensuring the market remains funded even if the stablecoin credit line reaches its cap. Users interact with one of the EtherFi Pay Spokes, which handles collateral, borrowing, and position tracking, and draws stablecoins from the Hub via a Stablecoins Draw Cap.</p>\n<p>Borrowers who draw GHO can route it through the Gho Stability Module to receive either USDC or USDT, enabling fiat conversion and supporting any payment card. GHO\u2019s borrowing rate is also likely to be less volatile due to the inherently flatter utilisation curve and can be customised through governance to support specific partnership arrangements.</p>\n<p>Whilst this Hub would likely be a net receiver of stablecoins from the Core Hub via the credit line, any idle USDC or EURC could be routed to Coinbase\u2019s Simple Earn product, acting as a low-risk staking option. The yield could be either directed to attract new deposits, routed to Aave DAO to enhance revenue generation, or used to reduce the EtherFi Foundation\u2019s opportunity cost of providing capital to the market.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks and Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Collateral is concentrated in a single asset, weETH or eBTC, in a single collateral-spoke configuration. Any de-pegging or slashing event would affect all positions in the absence of a diversification buffer. Stablecoin availability depends on Core Hub credit line and GHO Reserve caps, both governance-controlled. If both reach their limits during periods of high demand, borrowing may be temporarily constrained, though this is partially mitigated by the GHO Stewards, who can mint and deposit additional GHO on short notice.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-centralised-exchange-hub-coinbase-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-centralised-exchange-hub-coinbase-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Concept - Centralised Exchange Hub (Coinbase)</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/8f43db96c3192fc6fa6c8cbed6934908081d94ad.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/krnF65u5RfBi5bIULjoBGvb9sYJ.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/8f43db96c3192fc6fa6c8cbed6934908081d94ad.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"krnF65u5RfBi5bIULjoBGvb9sYJ\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Three isolated Spokes each pair a single collateral asset (cbBTC, cbETH, wETH) against USDC as the sole borrowable asset. Isolating each collateral ensures that a value impairment of one asset does not affect positions backed by other collateral types at the Spoke level. USDC liquidity enters through a Prime Hub stablecoin credit line, reflecting the lower risk profile of this Hub-and-Spoke combination. Idle USDC is routed into Coinbase Simple Earn, the native yield strategy for the Coinbase/Circle ecosystem, though governance could configure any instant-redeem alternative.</p>\n<p>To ensure the On-chain Earn yield from Coinbase exceeds the passive Simple Earn yield, the reinvestment feature, in combination with some account mapping by Coinbase, could direct a portion of the Simple Earn yield to On-chain Earn users to amplify the capital efficiency of the system. Such a system can be implemented using the Centralised Exchanges API and would amplify the On-chain Earn user case whilst still enhancing Aave DAO\u2019s revenue relative to the case with no reinvestment feature.<br>\n<strong>Risks and Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>A Coinbase operational issue could impact both cbBTC and cbETH simultaneously, even though they sit in separate Spokes.

The Stablecoins Spoke allows assets to be allocated into a purpose-curved Ethena Hub as supply-only deposits. To reduce Ethena\u2019s concentration risk, a Credit Line is provided from the Core Hub and a GHO Credit Line is extended via the Gho Reserve as a backstop, such that Ethena can supply/withdraw from the stablecoin spoke with ease.</p>\n<p>The two isolated cbBTC and wETH spokes indicate how Ethena is currently allocating a portion of USDe\u2019s backing to lending protocols that utilise isolated market structures. Each spoke can access liquidity for USDT, pyUSD, USDC, and GHO via Draw Caps.</p>\n<p>The Borrow Rate, set at the Hub, can be configured with a Steward/Risk Oracle to ensure that the Borrow Rate is relative to the Reinvestment feature rate of return, thereby ensuring that any assets backing USDe generate at least a specified ratio of the Reinvestment feature\u2019s returns.</p>\n<p>In this example, we use the Sky Savings Rate (SSR) for reference only. The market has a borrow rate linked to sUSDS and a premium equal to the Aave Fee. This is similar to how Spark deployed USDS to the Aave Prime instance, where the Borrow Rate was a function of the SSR plus a premium because it was not the Spark Protocol itself.</p>\n<p>Linking the Borrow Rate to the Reinvestment feature ensures that Ethena always earns at least the SSR. However, any asset with suitable liquidity could be used, such as a T+1 RWA earning over 5%, with additional considerations needed for managing the liquidity requirement. The larger GHO becomes, the easier it will be for GHO to facilitate providing the liquidity needed to ensure the market is always well capitalised. The user would need to migrate debt from another asset to GHO; however, this would be routed via the GSM to ensure a seamless user experience.</p>\n<p>In this market configuration, we demonstrate that the yield from the Reinvestment feature enhances returns on the assets backing USDe relative to actively allocating directly to the strategy or to a lending protocol, which has no floor yield (i.e., no reinvestment feature). Aave\u2019s revenue would be derived from the Reserve Factor on the debt, which would be expressed as a premium relative to the selected investment strategy if all the yield is directed to Ethena.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks and Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Backing assets serve dual roles as USDe redemption capital and Aave liquidity. During a contraction, mass redemptions may prompt withdrawals from the Hub as borrowing demand shifts. Bad debt on either Spoke is shared across all Hub suppliers, including Ethena\u2019s own deposits.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-aave-aligned-hub-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-aave-aligned-hub-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Concept - Aave-aligned Hub</strong></h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/2d8d419152eabd6f9b9302174b072378e88584e5.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/6uY7OpYCQU94eDAzaMmrlOwMqXP.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470891-y\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/2d8d419152eabd6f9b9302174b072378e88584e5.jpeg\" alt=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470891-y\" data-base62-sha1=\"6uY7OpYCQU94eDAzaMmrlOwMqXP\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This configuration establishes a dedicated Aave Aligned Hub containing two isolated Spokes, designed for borrowers who utilise protocol-aligned assets as collateral to access stablecoin liquidity. The Aave Spoke supports directly aligned collateral (stkAAVE, AAVE), while the Chianlink Spoke supports indirectly aligned collateral (LINK). Collateral across both Spokes is not rehypothecated and remains continuously available for withdrawal and liquidation, ensuring solvency restoration depends solely on spoke-level liquidation mechanics and enabling controlled tuning of risk and execution outcomes.</p>\n<p>Both Spokes support borrowing USDC and USDT from the Core Hub, alongside GHO introduced through a dedicated Gho Credit Line, each governed by an independent Add Cap. Whilst USDC and USDT provide diversity, the Gho Borrow Rate can be configured at a lower rate than that of other hubs to recognise stkAAVE and AAVE holders as part of a broader tokenomics benefits package.</p>\n<p>Given the borrower-aligned design of this Hub, a borrower-UX\u2013oriented liquidation configuration, featuring smaller liquidations and lower liquidation bonuses, should be considered across both Spokes. This approach minimises borrower disruption, reduces collateral loss, and maintains predictable liquidation behaviour, aligning with the Hub\u2019s objective of supporting protocol-aligned participants while preserving strong capital backing and controlled risk.</p>\n<p>While the collateral sets are subject to asset volatility, both Spokes intentionally bias slightly toward borrower UX relative to what volatility alone might suggest. This is enabled by strict isolation from the Core Hub, conservative add caps, and spoke-level risk containment, which together allow for a more gradual liquidation profile without materially increasing bad debt risk. In stressed scenarios, faster execution parameters remain available as a governance-controlled adjustment, allowing risk management to be tightened if market conditions warrant.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk and considerations</strong></p>\n<p>The Aave Spoke\u2019s collateral base is structurally correlated, as stkAAVE and AAVE are both closely linked to the Aave ecosystem and may be affected simultaneously by protocol-level events. The LINK Spoke introduces independent risk vectors LINK\u2019s value is driven by Chainlink network adoption and broader market conditions rather than Aave-specific dynamics. The two-spoke architecture ensures risk events in one Spoke do not propagate to the other. Risks across both Spokes are mitigated through conservative caps, spoke-level isolation, and governance-controlled parameters.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61584-conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-conclusion-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>This post outlines concepts of possible Hub-and-Spoke configurations enabled by V4. We covered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prime Hub:</strong> A lower risk, Senior market focusing on isolated use cases and offering controlled exposure to the most established multi-cycle assets, with a focus on fiat-backed stablecoins</li>\n<li><strong>Core Hub:</strong> Pools blue-chip collateral across multiple spokes, providing a risk-adjusted yield with elevated capital efficiency relative to v3 via the Reinvestment features.</li>\n<li><strong>Etherfi, Coinbase Hubs:</strong> Opinionated market participant hubs focused on specific use cases, optimised for each respective business\u2019s considerations</li>\n<li><strong>Ethena Hub:</strong>  A low-risk, isolated market structure could be positioned to generate a yield on assets that provide collateral backing for a stablecoin</li>\n<li><strong>Aave-Aligned Hub:</strong> Isolated Spokes for protocol-aligned assets like stkAAVE, AAVE, wstLINK &amp; LINK with preferential cost of capital alignment via a Gho Credit Line</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each design entails different trade-offs among capital efficiency, risk isolation, and liquidity depth.</p>\n<p>GHO is integral to every configuration as the backbone stablecoin across V4 markets. Each Hub draws GHO from the Reserve through independently capped Credit Lines, so governance controls exactly how much GHO enters each market and against what collateral. As these Hubs scale, GHO scales with them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that none of these are final recommendations. Risk parameterisation and asset listing decisions are controlled by AAVE token holders and elected Stewards, typically specialists, to facilitate operational implementation.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61584-disclaimer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-disclaimer-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclaimer</h1>\n<p>TokenLogic did not receive any payment for this post.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61584-copyright-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-copyright-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Copyright</h1>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived via <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CC0</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/hubs-spokes-in-aave-v4/24040\">Read full topic</a></p>\n          ",

Risk Premiums allow Spokes to price borrowing costs based on collateral quality; borrowers using riskier assets pay for the risk they introduce, rather than being subsidised by those posting ETH or BTC.

From the Reserve, GHO is distributed through independent channels, each with its own governance-controlled add cap, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lending Credit Lines</strong> to Prime, Aave-aligned Hub, Ethena, EtherFi, and Neobank Hubs, making GHO available for borrowing within each Hub\u2019s Spokes.</li>\n<li><strong>stataUSDC GSM</strong> and <strong>stataUSDT GSM</strong> for peg stability through direct swap mechanisms that are separate from the liquidity markets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each channel operates independently, so governance can scale GHO supply into high-demand Hubs while keeping tighter limits on newer environments without one affecting the capacity of another.</p>\n<p>Gho Stewards interact exclusively via the Credit Line funded by the Gho Reserve, with the Add Cap acting as the primary constraint on GHO expansion. This mirrors the economic role of the Gho Facilitator in Aave v3, where capacity is managed at the reserve level while the Add Cap replaces the Borrow Cap as the control on total GHO exposure. Governance and Gho Stewards retain direct authority over system growth through Credit Line adjustments.</p>\n<p>With each channel having its own cap and operating in a distinct market environment, governance can also <strong>choose precisely which collateral/risk profiles support incremental GHO supply</strong> (i.e., the <em>asset exposure</em> the protocol takes). This allows Aave to scale GHO where the underlying collateral and liquidation conditions are most trusted, while limiting exposure to newer or riskier setups.</p>\n<p>Separating stablecoin liquidity across distinct capped channels provides granular control over liquidity composition, liquidation behaviour, and surplus generation, while isolating each Spoke from broader Core market risk, allowing the Core market to provide a secondary-market savings option that complements sGHO, which has a suitably lower risk profile.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-prime-hub-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-prime-hub-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Concept - Prime Hub</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d222a41eeb7a9d743aa5570eacdd2a3dfdea61ff.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/tYWuc2bKw4Bly4HPRPigyfXmzjV.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d222a41eeb7a9d743aa5570eacdd2a3dfdea61ff.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"tYWuc2bKw4Bly4HPRPigyfXmzjV\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The Prime Hub best represents a more Senior market, characterised by isolated lending pools with tighter risk controls. Whilst a simple, isolated market structure can be created, the example above highlights how the Reinvestment feature could provide a distinct advantage relative to other markets. There are a few options for allocating the excess capital; one possibility is Simple Earn on Coinbase, or, to minimise counterparty risk, an allocation to a suitably low-risk Hub-and-Spoke, such as the Coinbase Hub-and-Spoke shown later. Creating such a market in which the supply yield always exceeds that of T-bills would be a welcome improvement relative to the current market, where supply rates are well below T-bill yields. The intention for this market is to limit collateral types to those with the lowest complexity, such as fiat-redeemable stablecoins and the most dominant BTC wrapper products.</p>\n<p>The graphic shows Lido\u2019s wstETH, the most dominant Liquid Staking Token (LST) with widespread adoption, as yield-generating collateral with the Max. Lido Yield Spoke is configured to support leverage yield strategies such as the stVault product. By isolating LST and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT) across the Hubs-and-Spoke, for example, Core and Prime, the market can price the risk associated with each collateral type. This also allows the cost of borrowing ETH to be market-determined without the need for directional/opinionated use of the Risk Premium between LRT and LSTs.</p>\n<p>Note: Lido\u2019s wstETH is used as an example, and other suitable LSTs may be included.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-core-hub-with-a-reinvestment-feature-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-core-hub-with-a-reinvestment-feature-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Concept - Core Hub with a Reinvestment Feature</strong></h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a94a9634794a5ce5bb0abce21b3e620f71b3a6a5.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/o9CuCnAbTv2mAnFGQstud52mIg5.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a94a9634794a5ce5bb0abce21b3e620f71b3a6a5.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"o9CuCnAbTv2mAnFGQstud52mIg5\" width=\"1647\" height=\"1400\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The Core market presented above is risk-adjusted and favours yield-generating collateral types, capital efficiency, and the creation of passive yield for the user, most similar to the existing Core market on Ethereum, with specialised Spokes, Draw Caps, and Add Caps used to limit asset exposure.</p>\n<p>Aave v4 expands the DAO\u2019s ability to express liquidity and risk policy at the system level, rather than having outcomes emerge solely as a by-product of utilisation dynamics. Idle stablecoin liquidity in the Core Hub is no longer structurally constrained to lower productivity; it can be allocated, within governance-defined bounds, into highly liquid, low-risk instruments, thereby establishing a baseline return profile for idle capital.</p>\n<p>This approach enhances capital efficiency without altering the protocol\u2019s liquidity assurances. By allowing a portion of idle capital to remain productive within governance-defined constraints, v4 supports a more stable return profile than prior versions, translating design flexibility into measured economic benefits at the protocol level.</p>\n<p><strong>Reinvestment Feature</strong></p>\n<p>Stablecoins sitting idle in the Core Hub (not currently borrowed by any Spoke) are put to work. A reinvestment controller routes them into yield strategies such as sUSDS to earn the Sky Savings Rate, Coinbase\u2019s Simple Earn, and potentially highly liquid RWAs. At scale, the reinvestment feature can behave like a portfolio to balance duration schedules and target a specific yield profile.</p>\n<p>The Core Hub also extends credit lines to other Hubs (Aave-aligned, EtherFi, Ethena). When borrowing demand increases, reinvested capital from yield strategies is immediately withdrawn and made available. The interest rate model accounts for the amount of reinvestment, so rates adjust accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks and considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Bad debt on any Spoke is shared across all Hub suppliers. Draw Caps are the primary safeguard, bounding maximum loss per Spoke. Reinvestment is only safe with instant-redeem strategies. If too much idle capital is reinvested and multiple Spokes spike utilisation simultaneously, there may not be enough instant liquidity to serve all withdrawals and borrows at once.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-neobank-configuration-etherfi-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-neobank-configuration-etherfi-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Concept  -  Neobank Configuration (EtherFi)</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d8011b62eaa286599e802f448ad19fb73b854881.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uORvkoIxpmR0ZeSw0tGQpofQT8B.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470875-y\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d8011b62eaa286599e802f448ad19fb73b854881.jpeg\" alt=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470875-y\" data-base62-sha1=\"uORvkoIxpmR0ZeSw0tGQpofQT8B\" width=\"1280\" height=\"704\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This configuration places a dedicated EtherFi Hub at the centre of a Neobank use case, in which users deposit weETH as collateral and borrow stablecoins that are loaded onto an EtherFi Pay card. weETH continues to earn restaking yield while serving as collateral, thereby allowing users maintain ETH exposure and staking returns while accessing stablecoin liquidity.</p>\n<p>Stablecoin liquidity enters the Hub through two paths. USDC and USDT are sourced from the Core Hub via a stablecoin credit line. GHO enters from the GHO Reserve through a GHO Credit Line with a defined Add Cap, acting as a backstop, ensuring the market remains funded even if the stablecoin credit line reaches its cap. Users interact with one of the EtherFi Pay Spokes, which handles collateral, borrowing, and position tracking, and draws stablecoins from the Hub via a Stablecoins Draw Cap.</p>\n<p>Borrowers who draw GHO can route it through the Gho Stability Module to receive either USDC or USDT, enabling fiat conversion and supporting any payment card. GHO\u2019s borrowing rate is also likely to be less volatile due to the inherently flatter utilisation curve and can be customised through governance to support specific partnership arrangements.</p>\n<p>Whilst this Hub would likely be a net receiver of stablecoins from the Core Hub via the credit line, any idle USDC or EURC could be routed to Coinbase\u2019s Simple Earn product, acting as a low-risk staking option. The yield could be either directed to attract new deposits, routed to Aave DAO to enhance revenue generation, or used to reduce the EtherFi Foundation\u2019s opportunity cost of providing capital to the market.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks and Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Collateral is concentrated in a single asset, weETH or eBTC, in a single collateral-spoke configuration. Any de-pegging or slashing event would affect all positions in the absence of a diversification buffer. Stablecoin availability depends on Core Hub credit line and GHO Reserve caps, both governance-controlled. If both reach their limits during periods of high demand, borrowing may be temporarily constrained, though this is partially mitigated by the GHO Stewards, who can mint and deposit additional GHO on short notice.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-centralised-exchange-hub-coinbase-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-centralised-exchange-hub-coinbase-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Concept - Centralised Exchange Hub (Coinbase)</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/8f43db96c3192fc6fa6c8cbed6934908081d94ad.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/krnF65u5RfBi5bIULjoBGvb9sYJ.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/8f43db96c3192fc6fa6c8cbed6934908081d94ad.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"krnF65u5RfBi5bIULjoBGvb9sYJ\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Three isolated Spokes each pair a single collateral asset (cbBTC, cbETH, wETH) against USDC as the sole borrowable asset.

Idle USDC is routed into Coinbase Simple Earn, the native yield strategy for the Coinbase/Circle ecosystem, though governance could configure any instant-redeem alternative.</p>\n<p>To ensure the On-chain Earn yield from Coinbase exceeds the passive Simple Earn yield, the reinvestment feature, in combination with some account mapping by Coinbase, could direct a portion of the Simple Earn yield to On-chain Earn users to amplify the capital efficiency of the system.

The Stablecoins Spoke allows assets to be allocated into a purpose-curved Ethena Hub as supply-only deposits. To reduce Ethena\u2019s concentration risk, a Credit Line is provided from the Core Hub and a GHO Credit Line is extended via the Gho Reserve as a backstop, such that Ethena can supply/withdraw from the stablecoin spoke with ease.</p>\n<p>The two isolated cbBTC and wETH spokes indicate how Ethena is currently allocating a portion of USDe\u2019s backing to lending protocols that utilise isolated market structures. Each spoke can access liquidity for USDT, pyUSD, USDC, and GHO via Draw Caps.</p>\n<p>The Borrow Rate, set at the Hub, can be configured with a Steward/Risk Oracle to ensure that the Borrow Rate is relative to the Reinvestment feature rate of return, thereby ensuring that any assets backing USDe generate at least a specified ratio of the Reinvestment feature\u2019s returns.</p>\n<p>In this example, we use the Sky Savings Rate (SSR) for reference only. The market has a borrow rate linked to sUSDS and a premium equal to the Aave Fee. This is similar to how Spark deployed USDS to the Aave Prime instance, where the Borrow Rate was a function of the SSR plus a premium because it was not the Spark Protocol itself.</p>\n<p>Linking the Borrow Rate to the Reinvestment feature ensures that Ethena always earns at least the SSR. However, any asset with suitable liquidity could be used, such as a T+1 RWA earning over 5%, with additional considerations needed for managing the liquidity requirement. The larger GHO becomes, the easier it will be for GHO to facilitate providing the liquidity needed to ensure the market is always well capitalised. The user would need to migrate debt from another asset to GHO; however, this would be routed via the GSM to ensure a seamless user experience.</p>\n<p>In this market configuration, we demonstrate that the yield from the Reinvestment feature enhances returns on the assets backing USDe relative to actively allocating directly to the strategy or to a lending protocol, which has no floor yield (i.e., no reinvestment feature). Aave\u2019s revenue would be derived from the Reserve Factor on the debt, which would be expressed as a premium relative to the selected investment strategy if all the yield is directed to Ethena.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks and Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Backing assets serve dual roles as USDe redemption capital and Aave liquidity. During a contraction, mass redemptions may prompt withdrawals from the Hub as borrowing demand shifts. Bad debt on either Spoke is shared across all Hub suppliers, including Ethena\u2019s own deposits.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-aave-aligned-hub-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-aave-aligned-hub-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Concept - Aave-aligned Hub</strong></h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/2d8d419152eabd6f9b9302174b072378e88584e5.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/6uY7OpYCQU94eDAzaMmrlOwMqXP.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470891-y\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/2d8d419152eabd6f9b9302174b072378e88584e5.jpeg\" alt=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470891-y\" data-base62-sha1=\"6uY7OpYCQU94eDAzaMmrlOwMqXP\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This configuration establishes a dedicated Aave Aligned Hub containing two isolated Spokes, designed for borrowers who utilise protocol-aligned assets as collateral to access stablecoin liquidity. The Aave Spoke supports directly aligned collateral (stkAAVE, AAVE), while the Chianlink Spoke supports indirectly aligned collateral (LINK). Collateral across both Spokes is not rehypothecated and remains continuously available for withdrawal and liquidation, ensuring solvency restoration depends solely on spoke-level liquidation mechanics and enabling controlled tuning of risk and execution outcomes.</p>\n<p>Both Spokes support borrowing USDC and USDT from the Core Hub, alongside GHO introduced through a dedicated Gho Credit Line, each governed by an independent Add Cap. Whilst USDC and USDT provide diversity, the Gho Borrow Rate can be configured at a lower rate than that of other hubs to recognise stkAAVE and AAVE holders as part of a broader tokenomics benefits package.</p>\n<p>Given the borrower-aligned design of this Hub, a borrower-UX\u2013oriented liquidation configuration, featuring smaller liquidations and lower liquidation bonuses, should be considered across both Spokes. This approach minimises borrower disruption, reduces collateral loss, and maintains predictable liquidation behaviour, aligning with the Hub\u2019s objective of supporting protocol-aligned participants while preserving strong capital backing and controlled risk.</p>\n<p>While the collateral sets are subject to asset volatility, both Spokes intentionally bias slightly toward borrower UX relative to what volatility alone might suggest. This is enabled by strict isolation from the Core Hub, conservative add caps, and spoke-level risk containment, which together allow for a more gradual liquidation profile without materially increasing bad debt risk. In stressed scenarios, faster execution parameters remain available as a governance-controlled adjustment, allowing risk management to be tightened if market conditions warrant.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk and considerations</strong></p>\n<p>The Aave Spoke\u2019s collateral base is structurally correlated, as stkAAVE and AAVE are both closely linked to the Aave ecosystem and may be affected simultaneously by protocol-level events. The LINK Spoke introduces independent risk vectors LINK\u2019s value is driven by Chainlink network adoption and broader market conditions rather than Aave-specific dynamics. The two-spoke architecture ensures risk events in one Spoke do not propagate to the other. Risks across both Spokes are mitigated through conservative caps, spoke-level isolation, and governance-controlled parameters.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61584-conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-conclusion-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>This post outlines concepts of possible Hub-and-Spoke configurations enabled by V4. We covered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prime Hub:</strong> A lower risk, Senior market focusing on isolated use cases and offering controlled exposure to the most established multi-cycle assets, with a focus on fiat-backed stablecoins</li>\n<li><strong>Core Hub:</strong> Pools blue-chip collateral across multiple spokes, providing a risk-adjusted yield with elevated capital efficiency relative to v3 via the Reinvestment features.</li>\n<li><strong>Etherfi, Coinbase Hubs:</strong> Opinionated market participant hubs focused on specific use cases, optimised for each respective business\u2019s considerations</li>\n<li><strong>Ethena Hub:</strong>  A low-risk, isolated market structure could be positioned to generate a yield on assets that provide collateral backing for a stablecoin</li>\n<li><strong>Aave-Aligned Hub:</strong> Isolated Spokes for protocol-aligned assets like stkAAVE, AAVE, wstLINK &amp; LINK with preferential cost of capital alignment via a Gho Credit Line</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each design entails different trade-offs among capital efficiency, risk isolation, and liquidity depth.</p>\n<p>GHO is integral to every configuration as the backbone stablecoin across V4 markets. Each Hub draws GHO from the Reserve through independently capped Credit Lines, so governance controls exactly how much GHO enters each market and against what collateral. As these Hubs scale, GHO scales with them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that none of these are final recommendations. Risk parameterisation and asset listing decisions are controlled by AAVE token holders and elected Stewards, typically specialists, to facilitate operational implementation.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61584-disclaimer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-disclaimer-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclaimer</h1>\n<p>TokenLogic did not receive any payment for this post.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61584-copyright-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-copyright-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Copyright</h1>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived via <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CC0</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>2 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/hubs-spokes-in-aave-v4/24040\">Read full topic</a></p>\n          ",

Summary</h1>\n<p>Aave began with the thesis that decentralized lending could play a major role in traditional finance. Eight years later, that thesis has been validated. Aave is the largest protocol in decentralized finance, commanding a 60% market share in lending. The opportunity ahead, however, is bigger than anything behind us.</p>\n<p>Detailed below is a strategic framework proposal for Aave\u2019s next chapter. It asks the Aave DAO to ratify Aave V4 as the protocol\u2019s foundational technology for future growth. It also proposes to direct all revenue from Aave-branded products built to the DAO treasury and to establish a budget for continued development. It also includes a solution to protect the Aave brand.</p>\n<p>This proposal asks the DAO to approve the following operational framework:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Direct 100% of Aave-branded product revenue to the Aave DAO treasury.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Commit to a solution for protecting the Aave brand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ratify Aave V4 as the protocol\u2019s core technical foundation for future development.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a framework for the DAO to fund strategic growth and development.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-h-2-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-h-2-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2. Motivation</h1>\n<p>The LEND token sale in 2017 raised $16M to build a decentralized lending protocol. That protocol became Aave, and that $16M has grown into a multi-billion dollar ecosystem, creating billions in value in the process.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Aave Labs has requested DAO funds only for direct protocol development and marketing activities. Everything else has been self-funded. This includes the product layer, which encompasses <a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a>, the Aave mobile app, Aave Pro, Aave Kit, and Aave Horizon. It also includes legal and regulatory work such as SEC defense, brand protection, trademark management, and compliance. Business development and growth has been self-funded as well.</p>\n<p><strong>We are now entering one of the most important periods that will determine Aave\u2019s success going forward.</strong> Fintechs are entering DeFi, institutions are coming onchain, and regulatory clarity is emerging in certain markets that allows us to go direct to consumers. The protocols that win the next decade will be those that move fast, build great tools and products, and capture new markets before competitors. With the right focus, and by investing in important growth areas, Aave is positioned to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>Other approaches to this framework exist, however they have different trade-offs. Aave Labs could operate independently and keep product revenue to fund itself, but then there would need to be a separation of the protocol revenues from the ones generated by the Aave-branded products built on top of the protocol. The DAO could directly build and operate Aave-branded products through governance, but the execution would be slow, and governance overhead can\u2019t scale indefinitely to meet the pace required.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-h-3-specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-h-3-specification-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3.

This has supported millions of users with zero security incidents. The DAO has matured quite a bit since AIP-1 and we believe it\u2019s time to align behind a token-centric model.</p>\n<p>Under this proposal, 100% of Aave Labs\u2019 product revenue will go to the DAO. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a>, the existing interface, and all associated fees</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave App, the consumer mobile application</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Card, a card tied to Aave App with all fees flowing to the DAO</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Pro, the new interface for Aave V4</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Kit, enterprise solutions for fintechs and institutions building on Aave</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Horizon, Aave\u2019s RWA market and institutional services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AAVE ETP, exchange traded product of $AAVE</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upon approval of this proposal, the DAO would also receive revenue from the swap integration on <a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a>, which currently generates approximately $10 million in annualized revenue. This integration is expected to expand to additional chains and functionality.</p>\n<p>Revenue is defined as gross product revenue earned by Aave Labs, minus any direct revenue sharing paid by Aave Labs to external partners including revenue rebates, revenue subsidies, revenue sharing arrangements and any additional direct user incentives.</p>\n<p>Product growth incentive budgets are funded by the Aave DAO. Additionally, Aave Labs retains the discretion to redirect a portion of product inflows, such as vault yields, directly into user incentives. Competing for users requires the ability to deploy capital quickly toward growth without waiting for a governance cycle. In these instances, Aave Labs will disclose additional user incentives spending in our quarterly updates.</p>\n<p>With proper execution, the product layer can be an additional source of revenue for the DAO treasury. Combined with protocol fees, the DAO can fund its own growth, security, and development from a diversified revenue stream.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61633-expanding-revenue-through-aave-v4-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-expanding-revenue-through-aave-v4-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Expanding Revenue Through Aave V4</h3>\n<p>The product layer is one part of the path to increasing the DAO\u2019s annual revenue.

Reaching these estimates would also depend on market conditions, scale of adoption, and execution.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Aave V4 also introduces a new reinvestment module, which is an optional net new revenue opportunity for the DAO to consider.</strong> Aave pools maintain a significant idle float that currently earns nothing. This reinvestment feature allows the protocol to sweep this capital into short-term, low-risk yield opportunities pre-vetted and approved by the DAO, similar to a collateral listing.</p>\n<p>When Aave rates fall below SOFR-rates, it signals underutilized liquidity that could be productively deployed.

This means prioritizing V4 Spoke development, aligning roadmaps, and shifting new feature work away from V3. Notably, V4 is already live on testnet, has completed an open security contest, and has its first <a href=\"https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2026-02-aave-v4-securityreview.pdf\">public audit</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The DAO is being asked to agree on this strategic direction and a separate proposal will follow for V4 protocol activation, the launch setup, etc.</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61633-v3-maintenance-plan-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-v3-maintenance-plan-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>V3 Maintenance Plan</h3>\n<p>That said, <strong>V3 should not be shut down hastily or haphazardly.</strong> V3 is stable, mature, and battle-tested.

Protecting it is in the best interest of the DAO, token holders, and the broader ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Today, Aave Labs is the exclusive legal owner of the Aave trademarks and has been solely responsible for holding, defending, and enforcing them.</strong> Because the DAO is not a legal entity, it cannot directly hold or defend trademarks. As a result, trademark stewardship has necessarily sat within Aave Labs.</p>\n<p><strong>For the past seven years, Aave Labs has carried this operational burden, and the work is hands-on, expensive, and necessary.</strong> <strong>Trademarks that are not actively and consistently defended can be weakened or lost</strong>, reducing the ability to control how a mark is used in commerce and increasing the risk of misuse or confusion.</p>\n<p>At the same time, there are understandable concerns around concentrating long-term control of such a critical asset within a single operating entity, particularly as the DAO continues to mature. <strong>To address this, and subject to DAO approval, Aave Labs proposes the creation of a Foundation that would assume responsibility for holding and stewarding the Aave trademarks going forward.</strong> The Foundation would be mandated to protect the brand, license it to approved entities, address unauthorized use, and operate in alignment with DAO-approved parameters.</p>\n<p>The details regarding the structure, governance, and execution of this Foundation, including any transfer or licensing of trademark rights, as well as proposed approaches to V4 codebase licensing, will be presented to the DAO in a follow-up proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61633-aave-market-access-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-aave-market-access-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>$AAVE Market Access</h2>\n<p>To go beyond the product/protocol layer and expand market access to $AAVE, <strong>Aave Labs will support partners to launch regulated, traditional market products referencing $AAVE as the underlying asset</strong>.

Historically, the ecosystem\u2019s direction of travel (via AIP-1) was to use fees generated by Aave-branded products, such as <a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a> and other product surfaces, to cover Aave Labs\u2019 product development, marketing, legal, and operational costs, while the DAO funded direct protocol version development carried out by Aave Labs.</p>\n<p>Under the proposed operational framework, all fees from Aave-branded products would go to the DAO treasury rather than supporting Aave Labs\u2019 operations and product development. In this configuration, the responsibility for funding Aave Labs\u2019 activities would shift correspondingly to the DAO.</p>\n<p>Aave Labs requests $25 million in stablecoins, 75,000 AAVE, with additional growth and development grants payable upon specific product launches. The funding would be structured as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Primary Grant:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>$5 million paid upfront upon approval of the proposal and $20 million streamed over the course of the year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>75,000 AAVE delivered upon approval of the proposal, unlocking linearly monthly over a 2 year period</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Growth/Development Grants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>$5,000,000 for Aave App launch, with funds used for user acquisition, marketing, and ongoing development</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$5,000,000 for Aave Pro launch, with funds used for user acquisition, marketing, and ongoing development</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$5,000,000 for Aave Card launch, with funds used for user acquisition, marketing, and ongoing development</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$2,500,000 for Aave Kit launch, with funds used for maintenance and marketing</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: For clarity, all funds will be spent on Aave-related efforts.</em></p>\n<p>Growth and development grants are released upon delivery and streamed over a period of six months, with governance confirming completion before funds are disbursed. They cover the cost of bringing each product to market, from engineering through go-to-market.</p>\n<p>Companies entering DeFi are well-capitalized and spending aggressively on product and distribution. To succeed in the market, Aave needs to invest at a similar scale. This commitment allows for long-term planning, aggressive hiring, and sustained investment in product and go-to-market without the friction of annual budget cycles.</p>\n<p>The funding requested is a significant expansion of scope beyond historical funding. To date, Aave Labs has largely self-funded the cost of building and scaling the product layer, seeking DAO support mainly for core protocol development and focused marketing. This proposal secures the investment needed to stay competitive and continue innovating over the next decade. Growing Aave and growing it to the scale of other TradFi alternatives requires stable, predictable funding so contributors can plan, hire, and execute at the standard of a global financial platform.</p>\n<p>Altogether, these funds are covering the following costs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Continued protocol development (V4 improvements, Spokes, core infrastructure, research, and development)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product engineering across Aave Pro, Aave App, Aave Kit, and other products</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product go-to-market, user acquisition, marketing (e.g. social media/SEO/content) and growth</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Business development</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Labs invests heavily in partnering with the largest institutional and fintech names to integrate with Aave.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Horizon asset onboarding and driving TVL/borrow growth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ongoing 360\u00b0 resource provision for institutional integrators, including technical, InfoSec and operational support.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application security</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave Labs runs an extensive monitoring program, and very heavy enterprise fees to social media platforms, to protect the Aave brand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Events, which historically Aave Labs has already run with funding from the DAO (e.g. rAAVE, DeFi Day)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With this capital, Aave Labs can build with the runway needed to succeed on the items outlined above. It would also reflect the DAO\u2019s decision to fund the level of execution required to support protocol operations at increased scale, should governance determine that expansion is warranted.</p>\n<p>In order to be as effective as possible, Aave Labs would retain autonomy over product strategy and operations. Building competitive products requires the ability to move quickly, make decisions without committee approval, and iterate based on market feedback. We suggest the same for other Service Providers who might choose to operate under this framework.</p>\n<p>The grants outlined above are for one year and would need to be revisited, if approved, 12 months after the proposal is decided on.</p>\n<p>In line with existing DAO practices, oversight of this work is exercised through governance. Aave Labs will provide regular transparency into its activities, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Quarterly updates on progress against funded initiatives, key metrics, and use of DAO-authorized resources</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ongoing updates on active workstreams and prioritization decisions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Continued open and responsive communication with the DAO through established governance channels</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61633-h-4-next-steps-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-h-4-next-steps-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4. Next Steps</h2>\n<p>Aave remains early in its journey. What exists today is a base layer, while the real scale of adoption lies ahead as global finance moves onchain. DeFi is still quite small in the grand scheme of things. And over the coming decades, trillions of dollars in assets will migrate onto open rails. In that world, Aave can become the core infrastructure for global finance.</p>\n<p>Since 2017, the focus has been on disciplined execution at the frontier, and that conviction has only strengthened. The next phase of growth, fueled by innovation, and institutional adoption will be led by Aave. With sustained commitment and effective execution, the protocol can support significantly greater scale over time and continue establishing itself as core liquidity infrastructure for the onchain economy.</p>\n<p>This proposal seeks to establish a framework for Aave\u2019s next decade. Upon approval, it would reaffirm Aave Labs\u2019 alignment with the DAO by directing all Aave-branded product revenue to the DAO treasury. It asks for the ratification of V4 as the technical foundation for this growth and for the funding to execute this vision. This framework\u2019s objective is to position the Aave Protocol as a core piece of global financial infrastructure, with the value it creates directed to the Aave DAO to fund its continued development and success.</p>\n<p>In accordance with Aave governance processes, this proposal is intended as an initial Temp Check to gather community feedback on the strategic direction outlined above. Any  commitments, structural changes, or funding allocations would proceed through the appropriate stages of discussion, refinement, and governance proposal stages prior to implementation.</p>\n<p>If the Temp Check is successful and the community supports this proposal, we will move forward with a formal ARFC submission.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-disclaimer-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-disclaimer-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclaimer</h1>\n<p>Historically, Aave Labs has self-funded its endeavors. Due to the nature of the proposal, Aave Labs would receive funding from the DAO in exchange for Aave Labs\u2019 revenue going to the DAO if passed. No third parties co-authored this proposal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-copyright-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-copyright-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Copyright</h1>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">Creative Commons Zero (CC0)</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-faq-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-faq-16\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>FAQ</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Why are so many significant items grouped into a single proposal? Shouldn\u2019t these be separate votes?</strong></p>\n<p>This proposal presents a single, cohesive strategy. The components are interconnected and depend on each other for success. For example, aligning on V4 as the core technical foundation informs how development efforts are prioritized, while the proposed funding framework supports coordinated execution across protocol and product workstreams. Voting on these items separately could result in a fragmented and unworkable plan. Approving the strategy without the technology, or the technology without the funding to build it, would be inefficient. This proposal is a complete strategic package, and voting on it as a whole ensures the DAO is aligned on a single, comprehensive path forward.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The funding request is substantial. Why does Aave Labs need this budget?</strong></p>\n<p>The requested budget reflects a deliberate shift in operating model rather than an incremental extension of past funding. Historically, Aave Labs subsidized a broad range of activities and requested DAO support primarily for direct protocol development and focused marketing. Under this framework, the DAO is choosing to fund a wider operational scope directly, including product engineering, go-to-market execution, product relevant legal and compliance work, and business development. This budget is intended to support long-term planning and execution at scale and to enable stable resourcing and sustained focus. It reflects a governance decision about how the DAO wishes to resource protocol-adjacent work as Aave engages more directly with an evolving and increasingly competitive market landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Why should the DAO fund Aave Labs now if it has been self-funded for so long?</strong></p>\n<p>By directing 100% of revenue to the DAO, Aave Labs will not be able to self-fund going forward. Without the ability to earn or raise revenue, there is no way to cover the costs across product development, business development, and other operational functions Aave Labs has historically funded. Without funding to continue this work these functions would stop.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Is this funding request annual?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Aave Labs will submit an annual budget proposal to the DAO for the work it performs. Each year\u2019s budget requires a separate governance vote, giving the DAO ongoing oversight of how funds are allocated.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What does \u201cautonomy\u201d mean in this proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>The proposal requests autonomy over certain operational and product strategy decisions. Building competitive products requires the ability to move quickly and iterate based on market feedback, which is difficult if every decision requires a vote. Accountability is central to this arrangement. Aave Labs commits to providing quarterly reports on progress, frequent updates on development, and continued open communication with the DAO. The DAO retains ultimate oversight through its control of the treasury and Aave Labs\u2019 funding stream. If Aave Labs does not meet its commitments or perform effectively, the DAO can choose not to continue contributing to this budget.</p>\n<p><strong>6. What does ratifying V4 mean in this proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>This vote asks the DAO to agree on a strategic direction. Ratifying V4 in this proposal means committing to it as the core technical foundation for future development. It signals to all service providers that V4 is the priority, allowing them to align their roadmaps and development efforts. This coordination is necessary to build the features that will achieve the proposal\u2019s goals. The subsequent vote to activate the V4 protocol will be a purely technical one, focused on the readiness of the code, launch parameters, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Why is there compensation tied to milestones?</strong></p>\n<p>Launching and scaling products involves costs beyond core development work. This includes go-to-market execution, partnership development, and ongoing operational support around the time a product is introduced. The milestone-based payments are intended to support these activities at key delivery points, aligning resourcing with product rollout. As all revenue from these products flows to the DAO, funding this work supports execution that directly contributes to the protocol\u2019s operational sustainability.</p>\n<p><strong>8. How does this framework impact other Service Providers working with the Aave DAO?</strong></p>\n<p>If the DAO ratifies this proposal, coordination among service providers will be important for efficient execution. Service providers funded by the DAO can align their work with this direction to maintain Aave\u2019s competitive position. Those who prefer to focus on different priorities can propose adjusting their scope accordingly. Additionally, the increased surface area for revenue generation established by this proposal creates a framework that other service providers can consider for their own work with the DAO.</p>\n            <p><small>14 posts - 13 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-will-win-framework/24055\">Read full topic</a></p>\n          ",

Summary</h1>\n<p>Aave began with the thesis that decentralized lending could play a major role in traditional finance. Eight years later, that thesis has been validated. Aave is the largest protocol in decentralized finance, commanding a 60% market share in lending. The opportunity ahead, however, is bigger than anything behind us.</p>\n<p>Detailed below is a strategic framework proposal for Aave\u2019s next chapter. It asks the Aave DAO to ratify Aave V4 as the protocol\u2019s foundational technology for future growth. It also proposes to direct all revenue from Aave-branded products built to the DAO treasury and to establish a budget for continued development. It also includes a solution to protect the Aave brand.</p>\n<p>This proposal asks the DAO to approve the following operational framework:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Direct 100% of Aave-branded product revenue to the Aave DAO treasury.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Commit to a solution for protecting the Aave brand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ratify Aave V4 as the protocol\u2019s core technical foundation for future development.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a framework for the DAO to fund strategic growth and development.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-h-2-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-h-2-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2. Motivation</h1>\n<p>The LEND token sale in 2017 raised $16M to build a decentralized lending protocol. That protocol became Aave, and that $16M has grown into a multi-billion dollar ecosystem, creating billions in value in the process.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Aave Labs has requested DAO funds only for direct protocol development and marketing activities. Everything else has been self-funded. This includes the product layer, which encompasses <a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a>, the Aave mobile app, Aave Pro, Aave Kit, and Aave Horizon. It also includes legal and regulatory work such as SEC defense, brand protection, trademark management, and compliance. Business development and growth has been self-funded as well.</p>\n<p><strong>We are now entering one of the most important periods that will determine Aave\u2019s success going forward.</strong> Fintechs are entering DeFi, institutions are coming onchain, and regulatory clarity is emerging in certain markets that allows us to go direct to consumers. The protocols that win the next decade will be those that move fast, build great tools and products, and capture new markets before competitors. With the right focus, and by investing in important growth areas, Aave is positioned to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>Other approaches to this framework exist, however they have different trade-offs. Aave Labs could operate independently and keep product revenue to fund itself, but then there would need to be a separation of the protocol revenues from the ones generated by the Aave-branded products built on top of the protocol. The DAO could directly build and operate Aave-branded products through governance, but the execution would be slow, and governance overhead can\u2019t scale indefinitely to meet the pace required.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-h-3-specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-h-3-specification-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3.

This has supported millions of users with zero security incidents. The DAO has matured quite a bit since AIP-1 and we believe it\u2019s time to align behind a token-centric model.</p>\n<p>Under this proposal, 100% of Aave Labs\u2019 product revenue will go to the DAO. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a>, the existing interface, and all associated fees</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave App, the consumer mobile application</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Card, a card tied to Aave App with all fees flowing to the DAO</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Pro, the new interface for Aave V4</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Kit, enterprise solutions for fintechs and institutions building on Aave</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Horizon, Aave\u2019s RWA market and institutional services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AAVE ETP, exchange traded product of $AAVE</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upon approval of this proposal, the DAO would also receive revenue from the swap integration on <a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a>, which currently generates approximately $10 million in annualized revenue.

Additionally, Aave Labs retains the discretion to redirect a portion of product inflows, such as vault yields, directly into user incentives. Competing for users requires the ability to deploy capital quickly toward growth without waiting for a governance cycle. In these instances, Aave Labs will disclose additional user incentives spending in our quarterly updates.</p>\n<p>With proper execution, the product layer can be an additional source of revenue for the DAO treasury.

Aave V3 already generates over $100 million in annualized revenue. <strong>Aave V4 expands on V3 with new monetization features that allow the protocol to capture more value from the risk it underwrites.</strong></p>\n<p>V4\u2019s architecture also unlocks revenue streams that are not easily possible in previous Aave versions. Each Spoke can extend Aave into a new market or use case, with its own risk parameters and revenue model. <strong>As with V3, 100% of Aave V4\u2019s protocol revenue will go to the DAO.</strong></p>\n<p>We\u2019ve taken a look at various products and protocols across the crypto and fintech industries to show estimations that highlight the size of the opportunities available:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/88a6f6078bfb1e91bb94699454f2ced4f23e7dca.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/juSEcoGK2H8QMCwiFniNnK96vH4.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"spoke-revenue-data\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/88a6f6078bfb1e91bb94699454f2ced4f23e7dca.jpeg\" alt=\"spoke-revenue-data\" data-base62-sha1=\"juSEcoGK2H8QMCwiFniNnK96vH4\" width=\"1921\" height=\"1046\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/96af8851eb834d92d90a03bb53f127b1515f6051.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lv1He5EH2wxO64MZvptA8muFHIB.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"revenue-flow-diagram\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/96af8851eb834d92d90a03bb53f127b1515f6051.jpeg\" alt=\"revenue-flow-diagram\" data-base62-sha1=\"lv1He5EH2wxO64MZvptA8muFHIB\" width=\"1921\" height=\"1046\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><em>* These opportunity estimates are based on other protocols or products in each category (e.g. Pendle, Fluid), and the size of the opportunity (e.g. OTC lending volume), etc. They each represent a net new revenue opportunity on top of what Aave generates today, and they are only possible to pursue in a scalable way once V4 is live. Reaching these estimates would also depend on market conditions, scale of adoption, and execution.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Aave V4 also introduces a new reinvestment module, which is an optional net new revenue opportunity for the DAO to consider.</strong> Aave pools maintain a significant idle float that currently earns nothing. This reinvestment feature allows the protocol to sweep this capital into short-term, low-risk yield opportunities pre-vetted and approved by the DAO, similar to a collateral listing.</p>\n<p>When Aave rates fall below SOFR-rates, it signals underutilized liquidity that could be productively deployed.

Adding new features to V3 requires modifying core protocol logic, which involves extensive audits and significant coordination overhead. <strong>Meanwhile V4\u2019s architecture allows new functionality to be added through Spokes without touching the core, making experimentation cheaper, faster, and safer.</strong></p>\n<p>Importantly, anything V3 does can be recreated on V4, but not vice versa. <strong>V4 is a strict superset of V3\u2019s capabilities, meaning no functionality is lost in the upgrade.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>V4\u2019s architecture expands the range of revenue models the protocol can support, which is why governance analysis considers higher-scale revenue scenarios when planning long-term operations.</strong> To capture the opportunities outlined above, Aave Labs and the rest of the DAO\u2019s service providers should coordinate development efforts around V4. This means prioritizing V4 Spoke development, aligning roadmaps, and shifting new feature work away from V3. Notably, V4 is already live on testnet, has completed an open security contest, and has its first <a href=\"https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2026-02-aave-v4-securityreview.pdf\">public audit</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The DAO is being asked to agree on this strategic direction and a separate proposal will follow for V4 protocol activation, the launch setup, etc.</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61633-v3-maintenance-plan-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-v3-maintenance-plan-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>V3 Maintenance Plan</h3>\n<p>That said, <strong>V3 should not be shut down hastily or haphazardly.</strong> V3 is stable, mature, and battle-tested. There is no need for a rushed, or forced, migration, and the transition should happen in three phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Active Development (Current). V3 remains the primary production system, with security patches, parameter updates, and critical maintenance continuing as normal. It also makes sense to pause any new features for V3 if this framework is passed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stable Maintenance (Upon V4 Launch). V4 becomes the primary technology layer for expansion and innovation. V3 documentation, tooling, and access points remain fully supported, and users migrate at their own pace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Legacy Support (8-12 Months After V4 Launch). Once V4 is mature, V3 parameters should be gradually adjusted to encourage migration, following the same approach used in past version transitions. V3 remains open indefinitely for withdrawals, with governance stepping in only for critical security issues.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>If the DAO ratifies this strategic direction, coordination among service providers will be important for efficient execution.</strong> Service providers funded by the DAO can align their work with this direction to maintain Aave\u2019s competitive position.

Protecting it is in the best interest of the DAO, token holders, and the broader ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Today, Aave Labs is the exclusive legal owner of the Aave trademarks and has been solely responsible for holding, defending, and enforcing them.</strong> Because the DAO is not a legal entity, it cannot directly hold or defend trademarks. As a result, trademark stewardship has necessarily sat within Aave Labs.</p>\n<p><strong>For the past seven years, Aave Labs has carried this operational burden, and the work is hands-on, expensive, and necessary.</strong> <strong>Trademarks that are not actively and consistently defended can be weakened or lost</strong>, reducing the ability to control how a mark is used in commerce and increasing the risk of misuse or confusion.</p>\n<p>At the same time, there are understandable concerns around concentrating long-term control of such a critical asset within a single operating entity, particularly as the DAO continues to mature. <strong>To address this, and subject to DAO approval, Aave Labs proposes the creation of a Foundation that would assume responsibility for holding and stewarding the Aave trademarks going forward.</strong> The Foundation would be mandated to protect the brand, license it to approved entities, address unauthorized use, and operate in alignment with DAO-approved parameters.</p>\n<p>The details regarding the structure, governance, and execution of this Foundation, including any transfer or licensing of trademark rights, as well as proposed approaches to V4 codebase licensing, will be presented to the DAO in a follow-up proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61633-aave-market-access-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-aave-market-access-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>$AAVE Market Access</h2>\n<p>To go beyond the product/protocol layer and expand market access to $AAVE, <strong>Aave Labs will support partners to launch regulated, traditional market products referencing $AAVE as the underlying asset</strong>. This includes the potential launch of $AAVE regulated futures, as well as a regulated spot exchange-traded product (ETP).</p>\n<p>The introduction of regulated futures and ETP products would represent a meaningful step toward institutional maturity for Aave, broadening access for professional and traditional investors.

If all of Aave Labs\u2019 product revenue flows to the DAO, the DAO would need to fund the ongoing development and growth of these products.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61633-aave-labs-funding-request-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-aave-labs-funding-request-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Aave Labs Funding Request</h3>\n<p>The DAO is facing a structural decision regarding Aave Labs\u2019 operating model going forward.</p>\n<p>Currently, Aave Labs self-funds a significant portion of its operations. Historically, the ecosystem\u2019s direction of travel (via AIP-1) was to use fees generated by Aave-branded products, such as <a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a> and other product surfaces, to cover Aave Labs\u2019 product development, marketing, legal, and operational costs, while the DAO funded direct protocol version development carried out by Aave Labs.</p>\n<p>Under the proposed operational framework, all fees from Aave-branded products would go to the DAO treasury rather than supporting Aave Labs\u2019 operations and product development. In this configuration, the responsibility for funding Aave Labs\u2019 activities would shift correspondingly to the DAO.</p>\n<p>Aave Labs requests $25 million in stablecoins, 75,000 AAVE, with additional growth and development grants payable upon specific product launches. The funding would be structured as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Primary Grant:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>$5 million paid upfront upon approval of the proposal and $20 million streamed over the course of the year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>75,000 AAVE delivered upon approval of the proposal, unlocking linearly monthly over a 2 year period</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Growth/Development Grants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>$5,000,000 for Aave App launch, with funds used for user acquisition, marketing, and ongoing development</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$5,000,000 for Aave Pro launch, with funds used for user acquisition, marketing, and ongoing development</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$5,000,000 for Aave Card launch, with funds used for user acquisition, marketing, and ongoing development</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$2,500,000 for Aave Kit launch, with funds used for maintenance and marketing</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: For clarity, all funds will be spent on Aave-related efforts.</em></p>\n<p>Growth and development grants are released upon delivery and streamed over a period of six months, with governance confirming completion before funds are disbursed. They cover the cost of bringing each product to market, from engineering through go-to-market.</p>\n<p>Companies entering DeFi are well-capitalized and spending aggressively on product and distribution. To succeed in the market, Aave needs to invest at a similar scale. This commitment allows for long-term planning, aggressive hiring, and sustained investment in product and go-to-market without the friction of annual budget cycles.</p>\n<p>The funding requested is a significant expansion of scope beyond historical funding. To date, Aave Labs has largely self-funded the cost of building and scaling the product layer, seeking DAO support mainly for core protocol development and focused marketing. This proposal secures the investment needed to stay competitive and continue innovating over the next decade. Growing Aave and growing it to the scale of other TradFi alternatives requires stable, predictable funding so contributors can plan, hire, and execute at the standard of a global financial platform.</p>\n<p>Altogether, these funds are covering the following costs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Continued protocol development (V4 improvements, Spokes, core infrastructure, research, and development)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product engineering across Aave Pro, Aave App, Aave Kit, and other products</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product go-to-market, user acquisition, marketing (e.g. social media/SEO/content) and growth</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Business development</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Labs invests heavily in partnering with the largest institutional and fintech names to integrate with Aave.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Horizon asset onboarding and driving TVL/borrow growth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ongoing 360\u00b0 resource provision for institutional integrators, including technical, InfoSec and operational support.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application security</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave Labs runs an extensive monitoring program, and very heavy enterprise fees to social media platforms, to protect the Aave brand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Events, which historically Aave Labs has already run with funding from the DAO (e.g. rAAVE, DeFi Day)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With this capital, Aave Labs can build with the runway needed to succeed on the items outlined above. It would also reflect the DAO\u2019s decision to fund the level of execution required to support protocol operations at increased scale, should governance determine that expansion is warranted.</p>\n<p>In order to be as effective as possible, Aave Labs would retain autonomy over product strategy and operations. Building competitive products requires the ability to move quickly, make decisions without committee approval, and iterate based on market feedback. We suggest the same for other Service Providers who might choose to operate under this framework.</p>\n<p>The grants outlined above are for one year and would need to be revisited, if approved, 12 months after the proposal is decided on.</p>\n<p>In line with existing DAO practices, oversight of this work is exercised through governance. Aave Labs will provide regular transparency into its activities, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Quarterly updates on progress against funded initiatives, key metrics, and use of DAO-authorized resources</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ongoing updates on active workstreams and prioritization decisions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Continued open and responsive communication with the DAO through established governance channels</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61633-h-4-next-steps-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-h-4-next-steps-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4. Next Steps</h2>\n<p>Aave remains early in its journey. What exists today is a base layer, while the real scale of adoption lies ahead as global finance moves onchain. DeFi is still quite small in the grand scheme of things. And over the coming decades, trillions of dollars in assets will migrate onto open rails. In that world, Aave can become the core infrastructure for global finance.</p>\n<p>Since 2017, the focus has been on disciplined execution at the frontier, and that conviction has only strengthened. The next phase of growth, fueled by innovation, and institutional adoption will be led by Aave. With sustained commitment and effective execution, the protocol can support significantly greater scale over time and continue establishing itself as core liquidity infrastructure for the onchain economy.</p>\n<p>This proposal seeks to establish a framework for Aave\u2019s next decade. Upon approval, it would reaffirm Aave Labs\u2019 alignment with the DAO by directing all Aave-branded product revenue to the DAO treasury. It asks for the ratification of V4 as the technical foundation for this growth and for the funding to execute this vision. This framework\u2019s objective is to position the Aave Protocol as a core piece of global financial infrastructure, with the value it creates directed to the Aave DAO to fund its continued development and success.</p>\n<p>In accordance with Aave governance processes, this proposal is intended as an initial Temp Check to gather community feedback on the strategic direction outlined above. Any  commitments, structural changes, or funding allocations would proceed through the appropriate stages of discussion, refinement, and governance proposal stages prior to implementation.</p>\n<p>If the Temp Check is successful and the community supports this proposal, we will move forward with a formal ARFC submission.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-disclaimer-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-disclaimer-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclaimer</h1>\n<p>Historically, Aave Labs has self-funded its endeavors. Due to the nature of the proposal, Aave Labs would receive funding from the DAO in exchange for Aave Labs\u2019 revenue going to the DAO if passed. No third parties co-authored this proposal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-copyright-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-copyright-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Copyright</h1>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">Creative Commons Zero (CC0)</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-faq-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-faq-16\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>FAQ</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Why are so many significant items grouped into a single proposal? Shouldn\u2019t these be separate votes?</strong></p>\n<p>This proposal presents a single, cohesive strategy. The components are interconnected and depend on each other for success. For example, aligning on V4 as the core technical foundation informs how development efforts are prioritized, while the proposed funding framework supports coordinated execution across protocol and product workstreams. Voting on these items separately could result in a fragmented and unworkable plan. Approving the strategy without the technology, or the technology without the funding to build it, would be inefficient. This proposal is a complete strategic package, and voting on it as a whole ensures the DAO is aligned on a single, comprehensive path forward.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The funding request is substantial. Why does Aave Labs need this budget?</strong></p>\n<p>The requested budget reflects a deliberate shift in operating model rather than an incremental extension of past funding. Historically, Aave Labs subsidized a broad range of activities and requested DAO support primarily for direct protocol development and focused marketing. Under this framework, the DAO is choosing to fund a wider operational scope directly, including product engineering, go-to-market execution, product relevant legal and compliance work, and business development. This budget is intended to support long-term planning and execution at scale and to enable stable resourcing and sustained focus. It reflects a governance decision about how the DAO wishes to resource protocol-adjacent work as Aave engages more directly with an evolving and increasingly competitive market landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Why should the DAO fund Aave Labs now if it has been self-funded for so long?</strong></p>\n<p>By directing 100% of revenue to the DAO, Aave Labs will not be able to self-fund going forward. Without the ability to earn or raise revenue, there is no way to cover the costs across product development, business development, and other operational functions Aave Labs has historically funded. Without funding to continue this work these functions would stop.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Is this funding request annual?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Aave Labs will submit an annual budget proposal to the DAO for the work it performs. Each year\u2019s budget requires a separate governance vote, giving the DAO ongoing oversight of how funds are allocated.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What does \u201cautonomy\u201d mean in this proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>The proposal requests autonomy over certain operational and product strategy decisions. Building competitive products requires the ability to move quickly and iterate based on market feedback, which is difficult if every decision requires a vote. Accountability is central to this arrangement. Aave Labs commits to providing quarterly reports on progress, frequent updates on development, and continued open communication with the DAO. The DAO retains ultimate oversight through its control of the treasury and Aave Labs\u2019 funding stream. If Aave Labs does not meet its commitments or perform effectively, the DAO can choose not to continue contributing to this budget.</p>\n<p><strong>6. What does ratifying V4 mean in this proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>This vote asks the DAO to agree on a strategic direction. Ratifying V4 in this proposal means committing to it as the core technical foundation for future development. It signals to all service providers that V4 is the priority, allowing them to align their roadmaps and development efforts. This coordination is necessary to build the features that will achieve the proposal\u2019s goals. The subsequent vote to activate the V4 protocol will be a purely technical one, focused on the readiness of the code, launch parameters, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Why is there compensation tied to milestones?</strong></p>\n<p>Launching and scaling products involves costs beyond core development work. This includes go-to-market execution, partnership development, and ongoing operational support around the time a product is introduced. The milestone-based payments are intended to support these activities at key delivery points, aligning resourcing with product rollout. As all revenue from these products flows to the DAO, funding this work supports execution that directly contributes to the protocol\u2019s operational sustainability.</p>\n<p><strong>8. How does this framework impact other Service Providers working with the Aave DAO?</strong></p>\n<p>If the DAO ratifies this proposal, coordination among service providers will be important for efficient execution. Service providers funded by the DAO can align their work with this direction to maintain Aave\u2019s competitive position. Those who prefer to focus on different priorities can propose adjusting their scope accordingly. Additionally, the increased surface area for revenue generation established by this proposal creates a framework that other service providers can consider for their own work with the DAO.</p>\n            <p><small>14 posts - 13 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-will-win-framework/24055\">Read full topic</a></p>\n          ",

With the addition of Aave Umbrella, the ecosystem\u2019s coverage mechanism, the protocol\u2019s resilience and security have reached new heights.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, it\u2019s natural to ask: how will Aave v4 evolve its interest rate model to compete with such a proven foundation?</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-why-this-matters-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-why-this-matters-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Why This Matters</strong></h3>\n<p>Aave has evolved beyond a standard DeFi lending protocol. It\u2019s already comparable to large banks, and it\u2019s heading toward <strong>$100B+ scale</strong>.  How interest rates are determined now affects more than DAO revenue, it affects the credibility, resilience, and long-term survival of the Aave protocol itself.</p>\n<p>History is clear: interest rate design is not a technical detail. It is one of the primary drivers of systemic failure in lending markets. Over time, lending systems have repeatedly faced a binary choice and both options have proven flawed.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pooled Risk \u2014 <em>The \u201cLehman Brothers\u201d Model</em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this model, safe and risky assets are mixed together. Interest rates fail to reflect true risk, and safe capital silently subsidizes dangerous behavior.</p>\n<p>Lehman Brothers (2008) pursued higher returns by concentrating risk and leverage in opaque asset pools. For a time, this boosted yields. But when market liquidity vanished and asset prices collapsed, the entire structure failed. Risk was hidden, mispriced, and ultimately socialized.</p>\n<p>A modern parallel is Silicon Valley Bank (2023). SVB followed what appeared to be a conservative strategy, holding high-quality, long-duration bonds. But it ignored interest rate risk. When rates rose rapidly, asset values collapsed. Combined with an unstable, uninsured deposit base and instant digital withdrawals, the result was a historic bank run.</p>\n<p>In both cases, the failure was not credit quality alone, it was mispriced interest rate risk.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Fragmented Markets \u2014 <em>The \u201cSilo\u201d Model</em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The opposite approach isolates risk entirely. Assets are placed in separate silos, and rates reflect local conditions accurately but at a cost. Capital becomes trapped and borrowing becomes scarce and expensive even when the system, as a whole, has ample resources.</p>\n<p>This dynamic played out during the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis.

It does not wait for deposits, borrows, or repayments. Rates derive from global utilization (not isolated per pool) and aggressive borrowers do not subsidize conservative ones. Risk is priced separately via Spoke premiums and exotic collateral does not dilute safe yields. Lenders are compensated based on the real demand for their capital, not on where it happens to reside.</p>\n<p>Unlike previous Aave versions, interest is not a local property of individual pools. It is a global price of liquidity derived from aggregate demand across the system. Hub-level indexes record this history and update automatically over time, before any user interaction occurs.</p>\n<p>Risk is treated separately. Spokes apply premiums and these premiums are paid only by the borrower creating the risk, leaving the base liquidity price and safe lender yield unaffected. Interest and risk are decoupled, transparent, and fully contained, with risk serving as an adjustable overlay.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-12-liquidity-pricing-vs-risk-pricing-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-12-liquidity-pricing-vs-risk-pricing-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>1.2 Liquidity Pricing vs Risk Pricing</strong></h3>\n<p>Aave v4 uses the same two-slope <strong>formula</strong> as Aave v3, but calculates it at the Hub level using <strong>global utilization</strong> instead of per-market isolation.

It alone computes interest rates, tracks utilization, and advances interest over time. Interest accrues continuously at the Hub, independent of which Spokes are active or which users interact with the system. This makes rates <strong>global, deterministic, and consistent</strong> across all users of a given asset.</p>\n<p>Spokes do not calculate interest or track utilization. Their purpose is to define behavior at the edges: they set which collateral is accepted, borrowing rules, and risk premiums. Any risk is priced <strong>on top of the Hub\u2019s base rate</strong>, leaving the underlying liquidity price and safe lender yield untouched. In other words, the Hub prices capital, and Spokes price risk.</p>\n<p>By separating capital and risk in this way, Aave v4 becomes simpler to reason about. Liquidity is priced at the Hub, risk is priced at the Spoke, interest accrues globally, behavior is expressed locally, capital flows efficiently, and those who create risk are the ones who pay for it.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/516de155dec18e2a30b273090414b18472ce0c58.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/bCm5J7P3Q0JP2WSAhz9OuZ285v2.png?dl=1\" title=\"aave v4 check point\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/516de155dec18e2a30b273090414b18472ce0c58.png\" alt=\"aave v4 check point\" data-base62-sha1=\"bCm5J7P3Q0JP2WSAhz9OuZ285v2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"500\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong><code>LOCKED IN 1</code></strong> There is one base price of liquidity per asset, computed at the Hub<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 2</code></strong> All lenders earn from the same utilization signal<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 3</code></strong> Risk is priced explicitly via Spoke premiums<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 4</code></strong> Interest accrues deterministically, independent of user actions</p>\n<p>What you have not yet seen:</p>\n<p><strong><code>AHEAD 1</code></strong> How utilization maps to rates<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 2</code></strong> The mathematical form of the interest model<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 3</code></strong> How accrual works minute-by-minute<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 4</code></strong> How this architecture behaves under stress</p>\n<p><strong>Next:</strong><br>\nSection 2 explains <strong>how interest rate is actually formed</strong>, first conceptually, then formally.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61370-section-2-interest-rate-mathematics-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-section-2-interest-rate-mathematics-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>SECTION 2 \u2014 INTEREST RATE MATHEMATICS</strong></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-21-global-pricing-local-behavior-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-21-global-pricing-local-behavior-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>2.1 Global Pricing, Local Behavior</strong></h3>\n<p>The Hub aggregates utilization across all Spokes, creating a <strong>global, unified view of demand</strong>.

Interest accrues continuously, and if every balance were updated as time passed, the system would be forced to touch every account repeatedly even when no one interacts.</p>\n<p>Aave v4 avoids this entirely by shifting where interest is applied. Instead of updating individual balances, the Hub advances shared indexes that represent the cumulative growth of supplied capital and outstanding debt over time. Users do not hold balances that grow on their own, instead, they hold fixed positions whose value is determined by the current index.</p>\n<p><strong>User Balance = User Shares \u00d7 Current Index</strong></p>\n<p>This creates a simple relationship: a user\u2019s balance is the product of their position and the relevant index. When a balance is queried or a transaction is executed, the correct value is derived instantly from the latest index without any historical replay.</p>\n<p>This design also preserves the correct economic asymmetry between lenders and borrowers. Borrowed debt compounds because unpaid interest becomes part of the principal. Supplied capital grows linearly because interest is generated only on the portion of liquidity that is actually borrowed.

In earlier protocol architectures, risk was handled in a binary fashion: a collateral type was either allowed or disallowed. Once admitted, all assets largely shared the same interest rate environment. This approach produced blunt outcomes. If risky collateral was excluded entirely, some borrowers lost access to liquidity. If risky collateral was included, the risk was implicitly spread across all users, regardless of their actual exposure.</p>\n<p>Aave v4 replaces this blunt model with granular and transparent risk pricing. The base interest rate reflects system-wide demand for liquidity, while risk premiums are applied only to borrowers who introduce incremental risk. By keeping liquidity unified and pricing risk directly, Aave v4 ensures that risk becomes a visible, measurable input rather than a hidden externality. Utilization determines the base price, risk determines the premium, and any losses remain with the positions that actually generate the risk.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-52-individual-risk-vectors-40\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-52-individual-risk-vectors-40\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>5.2 Individual Risk Vectors</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Risk Vector</th>\n<th>v3 Behavior</th>\n<th>v4 Isolation Mechanism</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Bad Collateral</td>\n<td>Affects entire pool\u2019s risk profile</td>\n<td>Spoke-level: Only borrowers using that collateral pay premium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Liquidation Cascade</td>\n<td>Can drain pool liquidity</td>\n<td>Hub maintains global liquidity buffer; Spoke pauses independently</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oracle Failure</td>\n<td>Freezes entire market</td>\n<td>Affected Spoke freezes; other Spokes continue operating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Smart Contract Bug</td>\n<td>Compromises all reserves</td>\n<td>Bug isolated to affected Spoke; Hub remains intact</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-53-who-bears-what-risk-41\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-53-who-bears-what-risk-41\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>5.3 Who Bears What Risk</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Risk Type</th>\n<th>Who Bears It</th>\n<th>Mitigation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Collateral volatility</td>\n<td>Borrower using that collateral</td>\n<td>Risk premium + liquidation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spoke smart contract bug</td>\n<td>Users of that Spoke</td>\n<td>Isolated contract scope</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oracle manipulation</td>\n<td>Spoke relying on oracle</td>\n<td>Multiple oracle sources + delays</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deficit (bad debt)</td>\n<td>Protocol reserves \u2192 Lenders (last resort)</td>\n<td>Safety module + insurance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hub smart contract bug</td>\n<td>Systemic (all users)</td>\n<td>Extensive audits + formal verification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-54-non-negotiable-rules-42\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-54-non-negotiable-rules-42\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>5.4 Non-Negotiable Rules</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Rule</th>\n<th>Never Allowed</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Base rate</td>\n<td>Cannot be influenced by individual collateral risk or Spoke premiums.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Premiums</td>\n<td>Cannot be socialized across unrelated users or Spokes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Losses</td>\n<td>Cannot be spread outside the originating risk compartment.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Index math</td>\n<td>Cannot be altered by Spoke-level risk adjustments.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Safety</td>\n<td>Cannot depend on transaction ordering; must remain deterministic.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"p-61370-section-6-strategic-implications-43\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-section-6-strategic-implications-43\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>SECTION 6 \u2014 STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS</strong></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-61-capital-efficiency-gains-44\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-61-capital-efficiency-gains-44\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>6.1 Capital Efficiency Gains</strong></h3>\n<p>Aave v4\u2019s interest rate architecture is more than a technical upgrade; it reshapes how capital is priced and allocated.

With the addition of Aave Umbrella, the ecosystem\u2019s coverage mechanism, the protocol\u2019s resilience and security have reached new heights.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, it\u2019s natural to ask: how will Aave v4 evolve its interest rate model to compete with such a proven foundation?</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-why-this-matters-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-why-this-matters-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Why This Matters</strong></h3>\n<p>Aave has evolved beyond a standard DeFi lending protocol. It\u2019s already comparable to large banks, and it\u2019s heading toward <strong>$100B+ scale</strong>.  How interest rates are determined now affects more than DAO revenue, it affects the credibility, resilience, and long-term survival of the Aave protocol itself.</p>\n<p>History is clear: interest rate design is not a technical detail. It is one of the primary drivers of systemic failure in lending markets. Over time, lending systems have repeatedly faced a binary choice and both options have proven flawed.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pooled Risk \u2014 <em>The \u201cLehman Brothers\u201d Model</em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this model, safe and risky assets are mixed together. Interest rates fail to reflect true risk, and safe capital silently subsidizes dangerous behavior.</p>\n<p>Lehman Brothers (2008) pursued higher returns by concentrating risk and leverage in opaque asset pools. For a time, this boosted yields. But when market liquidity vanished and asset prices collapsed, the entire structure failed. Risk was hidden, mispriced, and ultimately socialized.</p>\n<p>A modern parallel is Silicon Valley Bank (2023). SVB followed what appeared to be a conservative strategy, holding high-quality, long-duration bonds. But it ignored interest rate risk. When rates rose rapidly, asset values collapsed. Combined with an unstable, uninsured deposit base and instant digital withdrawals, the result was a historic bank run.</p>\n<p>In both cases, the failure was not credit quality alone, it was mispriced interest rate risk.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Fragmented Markets \u2014 <em>The \u201cSilo\u201d Model</em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The opposite approach isolates risk entirely. Assets are placed in separate silos, and rates reflect local conditions accurately but at a cost. Capital becomes trapped and borrowing becomes scarce and expensive even when the system, as a whole, has ample resources.</p>\n<p>This dynamic played out during the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. Countries sharing the same currency experienced wildly divergent interest rates. Fragmented markets drove instability and the system lacked a mechanism to price risk without breaking capital mobility.</p>\n<p>This is why interest rate design in Aave v4 matters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-what-this-analysis-is-intended-to-cover-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-what-this-analysis-is-intended-to-cover-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>What this analysis is intended to cover</strong></h3>\n<p>This analysis examines how these mechanisms interact to determine interest rates in Aave v4. In particular, it considers the <strong>mathematical formulation of rates</strong>, the <strong>impact of liquidity allocation across markets</strong>, and the <strong>architectural guarantees</strong> that isolate risk while enabling capital mobility. By exploring these aspects, the analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of how Aave v4 interest rates function across multiple borrower and lender contexts.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-what-this-analysis-is-not-intended-to-cover-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-what-this-analysis-is-not-intended-to-cover-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>What this analysis is NOT intended to cover</strong></h3>\n<p>This analysis does not evaluate specific asset listings, propose risk parameters, or offer spokes investment guidance. It does not compare Aave v4 rates to other protocols, nor does it address macroeconomic impacts or adoption potential. The scope is intentionally limited to the <strong>design and mechanics of interest rate within Aave v4</strong>, in order to support a focused technical discussion before extending the analysis to broader lending market dynamics.</p>\n<p>By the end, you\u2019ll understand not only how Aave v4 interest rates function, but why I believe this design <strong>represents a structural improvement</strong> in how decentralized credit markets allocate capital.

It does not wait for deposits, borrows, or repayments. Rates derive from global utilization (not isolated per pool) and aggressive borrowers do not subsidize conservative ones. Risk is priced separately via Spoke premiums and exotic collateral does not dilute safe yields. Lenders are compensated based on the real demand for their capital, not on where it happens to reside.</p>\n<p>Unlike previous Aave versions, interest is not a local property of individual pools. It is a global price of liquidity derived from aggregate demand across the system. Hub-level indexes record this history and update automatically over time, before any user interaction occurs.</p>\n<p>Risk is treated separately. Spokes apply premiums and these premiums are paid only by the borrower creating the risk, leaving the base liquidity price and safe lender yield unaffected. Interest and risk are decoupled, transparent, and fully contained, with risk serving as an adjustable overlay.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-12-liquidity-pricing-vs-risk-pricing-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-12-liquidity-pricing-vs-risk-pricing-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>1.2 Liquidity Pricing vs Risk Pricing</strong></h3>\n<p>Aave v4 uses the same two-slope <strong>formula</strong> as Aave v3, but calculates it at the Hub level using <strong>global utilization</strong> instead of per-market isolation. This is a <strong>relocation</strong> of calculation, not a change in curve shape.</p>\n<p>The following table summarizes the differences in interest rates between V3 and v4, This table makes the functional separation between Hub (global liquidity) and Spokes (local risk) immediately clear, showing how Aave v4 resolves the key inefficiencies of V3:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Feature</th>\n<th><strong>Aave V3</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Aave v4</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Scope of Interest Rates</strong></td>\n<td>Each market computes its own interest rate; rates are local and isolated</td>\n<td>Base rate is computed centrally at the Hub per asset and applied uniformly across all Spokes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Liquidity Tracking</strong></td>\n<td>Utilization tracked independently per market</td>\n<td>Hub tracks global utilization per asset across all Spokes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Risk Expression</strong></td>\n<td>Risk indirectly influences rates; safe deposits may be diluted by risky demand</td>\n<td>Risk premiums are applied locally by Spokes; only risk-taking borrowers pay</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Borrower Experience</strong></td>\n<td>Identical borrowers in different markets can face different rates due to isolation</td>\n<td>All borrowers start from the same Hub base rate; premiums added only when required</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Capital Efficiency</strong></td>\n<td>Fragmented liquidity trapped in isolated pools</td>\n<td>Unified liquidity serving multiple markets without diluting low-risk yield</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Interest Accrual</strong></td>\n<td>Market-specific accrual based on local utilization</td>\n<td>Deterministic, global accrual via Hub-level indexes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Control Over Interest</strong></td>\n<td>Each pool independently computes rates</td>\n<td>Hub is the sole rate authority; Spokes define risk premiums but cannot alter base rates</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-13-deterministic-accrual-and-economic-ordering-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-13-deterministic-accrual-and-economic-ordering-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>1.3 Deterministic Accrual and Economic Ordering</strong></h3>\n<p>The Hub is the <strong>sole source of economic truth</strong>. It alone computes interest rates, tracks utilization, and advances interest over time. Interest accrues continuously at the Hub, independent of which Spokes are active or which users interact with the system. This makes rates <strong>global, deterministic, and consistent</strong> across all users of a given asset.</p>\n<p>Spokes do not calculate interest or track utilization. Their purpose is to define behavior at the edges: they set which collateral is accepted, borrowing rules, and risk premiums. Any risk is priced <strong>on top of the Hub\u2019s base rate</strong>, leaving the underlying liquidity price and safe lender yield untouched. In other words, the Hub prices capital, and Spokes price risk.</p>\n<p>By separating capital and risk in this way, Aave v4 becomes simpler to reason about. Liquidity is priced at the Hub, risk is priced at the Spoke, interest accrues globally, behavior is expressed locally, capital flows efficiently, and those who create risk are the ones who pay for it.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/516de155dec18e2a30b273090414b18472ce0c58.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/bCm5J7P3Q0JP2WSAhz9OuZ285v2.png?dl=1\" title=\"aave v4 check point\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/516de155dec18e2a30b273090414b18472ce0c58.png\" alt=\"aave v4 check point\" data-base62-sha1=\"bCm5J7P3Q0JP2WSAhz9OuZ285v2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"500\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong><code>LOCKED IN 1</code></strong> There is one base price of liquidity per asset, computed at the Hub<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 2</code></strong> All lenders earn from the same utilization signal<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 3</code></strong> Risk is priced explicitly via Spoke premiums<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 4</code></strong> Interest accrues deterministically, independent of user actions</p>\n<p>What you have not yet seen:</p>\n<p><strong><code>AHEAD 1</code></strong> How utilization maps to rates<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 2</code></strong> The mathematical form of the interest model<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 3</code></strong> How accrual works minute-by-minute<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 4</code></strong> How this architecture behaves under stress</p>\n<p><strong>Next:</strong><br>\nSection 2 explains <strong>how interest rate is actually formed</strong>, first conceptually, then formally.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61370-section-2-interest-rate-mathematics-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-section-2-interest-rate-mathematics-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>SECTION 2 \u2014 INTEREST RATE MATHEMATICS</strong></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-21-global-pricing-local-behavior-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-21-global-pricing-local-behavior-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>2.1 Global Pricing, Local Behavior</strong></h3>\n<p>The Hub aggregates utilization across all Spokes, creating a <strong>global, unified view of demand</strong>. This ensures that the base interest rate reflects real scarcity, not local imbalances or fragmented pools. Lenders earn yield based on total system demand, while borrowers face rates that accurately price liquidity.</p>\n<p>Once utilization is known, it is mapped to an interest rate using a two segment curve. At low utilization levels, the rate increases gradually. This region encourages borrowing and keeps capital productive when liquidity is plentiful. As utilization approaches a critical threshold, the curve steepens sharply.</p>\n<p>The utilization-based interest curve used in Aave v4 has two regions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A gradual slope below an optimal utilization threshold</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A steep, punitive slope above it</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below the optimal point, rates exist to encourage borrowing and keep capital productive. Above it, rates exist to defend liquidity buffers and prevent exhaustion. The steep region is intentionally punitive. Extremely high rates are designed to create overwhelming incentives for borrowers to repay and for lenders to supply additional liquidity.

When Bob repays on Day 30, the system doesn\u2019t need to replay history, it simply multiplies his <strong>Debt Shares \u00d7 1.003020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>index is the source of truth</strong>, capturing all growth and friction automatically. When <strong>utilization changes</strong>, the base rate adjusts for future accrual. When a <strong>Spoke updates a risk premium</strong>, that adjustment only affects future interest.</p>\n<p>This design creates a closed economic loop where utilization drives interest rates, rates advance the indexes, and indexes deterministically govern all user outcomes. With the Hub-and-Spoke architecture enforcing these guarantees at the system level, the protocol achieves economic behavior that is both cryptographically transparent and architecturally robust, transforming what could be fragmented cross-chain state into a unified, verifiable source of truth.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-34-why-indexes-instead-of-balance-updates-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-34-why-indexes-instead-of-balance-updates-17\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>3.4 Why Indexes Instead of Balance Updates?</strong></h3>\n<p>At protocol scale, updating user balances directly is just inefficient. Interest accrues continuously, and if every balance were updated as time passed, the system would be forced to touch every account repeatedly even when no one interacts.</p>\n<p>Aave v4 avoids this entirely by shifting where interest is applied. Instead of updating individual balances, the Hub advances shared indexes that represent the cumulative growth of supplied capital and outstanding debt over time. Users do not hold balances that grow on their own, instead, they hold fixed positions whose value is determined by the current index.</p>\n<p><strong>User Balance = User Shares \u00d7 Current Index</strong></p>\n<p>This creates a simple relationship: a user\u2019s balance is the product of their position and the relevant index. When a balance is queried or a transaction is executed, the correct value is derived instantly from the latest index without any historical replay.</p>\n<p>This design also preserves the correct economic asymmetry between lenders and borrowers. Borrowed debt compounds because unpaid interest becomes part of the principal. Supplied capital grows linearly because interest is generated only on the portion of liquidity that is actually borrowed. Separate indexes encode this difference directly, and the gap between them naturally reflects protocol fees and idle capital.</p>\n<p>When interest rates change, the system does not average past and present conditions. The index simply continues to advance using the new rate from that point forward. Earlier growth remains embedded, and future growth layers on top. The result is a single number that fully captures the path of rates over time.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/516de155dec18e2a30b273090414b18472ce0c58.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/bCm5J7P3Q0JP2WSAhz9OuZ285v2.png?dl=1\" title=\"aave v4 check point\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/516de155dec18e2a30b273090414b18472ce0c58.png\" alt=\"aave v4 check point\" data-base62-sha1=\"bCm5J7P3Q0JP2WSAhz9OuZ285v2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"500\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong><code>LOCKED IN 1</code></strong> Borrower debt compounds while lender balances grow linearly.<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 2</code></strong> Interest accrual always happens <strong>before</strong> any user action.<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 3</code></strong> Interest is applied via global indexes instead of updating user balances.<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 4</code></strong> Interest timing games and rate manipulation are structurally impossible.</p>\n<p>What you have not yet seen:</p>\n<p><strong><code>AHEAD 1</code></strong> Why accrual is deterministic and independent of user behavior.<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 2</code></strong> Where Spokes are allowed to intervene and where they are not.<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 3</code></strong> How this design scales without increasing complexity or gas cost.<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 4</code></strong> How these rules are enforced at the contract level.</p>\n<p><strong>Next:</strong><br>\nSection 4 shows <strong>how the Hub/Spoke architecture enforces these guarantees in code</strong>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61370-section-4-interest-rate-architecture-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-section-4-interest-rate-architecture-18\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>SECTION 4 \u2014 INTEREST RATE ARCHITECTURE</strong></h2>\n<p>Aave v4 separates economic state from behavioral logic.

In earlier protocol architectures, risk was handled in a binary fashion: a collateral type was either allowed or disallowed. Once admitted, all assets largely shared the same interest rate environment. This approach produced blunt outcomes. If risky collateral was excluded entirely, some borrowers lost access to liquidity. If risky collateral was included, the risk was implicitly spread across all users, regardless of their actual exposure.</p>\n<p>Aave v4 replaces this blunt model with granular and transparent risk pricing. The base interest rate reflects system-wide demand for liquidity, while risk premiums are applied only to borrowers who introduce incremental risk. By keeping liquidity unified and pricing risk directly, Aave v4 ensures that risk becomes a visible, measurable input rather than a hidden externality. Utilization determines the base price, risk determines the premium, and any losses remain with the positions that actually generate the risk.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-52-individual-risk-vectors-40\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-52-individual-risk-vectors-40\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>5.2 Individual Risk Vectors</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Risk Vector</th>\n<th>v3 Behavior</th>\n<th>v4 Isolation Mechanism</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Bad Collateral</td>\n<td>Affects entire pool\u2019s risk profile</td>\n<td>Spoke-level: Only borrowers using that collateral pay premium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Liquidation Cascade</td>\n<td>Can drain pool liquidity</td>\n<td>Hub maintains global liquidity buffer; Spoke pauses independently</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oracle Failure</td>\n<td>Freezes entire market</td>\n<td>Affected Spoke freezes; other Spokes continue operating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Smart Contract Bug</td>\n<td>Compromises all reserves</td>\n<td>Bug isolated to affected Spoke; Hub remains intact</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-53-who-bears-what-risk-41\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-53-who-bears-what-risk-41\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>5.3 Who Bears What Risk</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Risk Type</th>\n<th>Who Bears It</th>\n<th>Mitigation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Collateral volatility</td>\n<td>Borrower using that collateral</td>\n<td>Risk premium + liquidation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spoke smart contract bug</td>\n<td>Users of that Spoke</td>\n<td>Isolated contract scope</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oracle manipulation</td>\n<td>Spoke relying on oracle</td>\n<td>Multiple oracle sources + delays</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deficit (bad debt)</td>\n<td>Protocol reserves \u2192 Lenders (last resort)</td>\n<td>Safety module + insurance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hub smart contract bug</td>\n<td>Systemic (all users)</td>\n<td>Extensive audits + formal verification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-54-non-negotiable-rules-42\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-54-non-negotiable-rules-42\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>5.4 Non-Negotiable Rules</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Rule</th>\n<th>Never Allowed</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Base rate</td>\n<td>Cannot be influenced by individual collateral risk or Spoke premiums.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Premiums</td>\n<td>Cannot be socialized across unrelated users or Spokes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Losses</td>\n<td>Cannot be spread outside the originating risk compartment.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Index math</td>\n<td>Cannot be altered by Spoke-level risk adjustments.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Safety</td>\n<td>Cannot depend on transaction ordering; must remain deterministic.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"p-61370-section-6-strategic-implications-43\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-section-6-strategic-implications-43\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>SECTION 6 \u2014 STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS</strong></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-61-capital-efficiency-gains-44\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-61-capital-efficiency-gains-44\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>6.1 Capital Efficiency Gains</strong></h3>\n<p>Aave v4\u2019s interest rate architecture is more than a technical upgrade; it reshapes how capital is priced and allocated.

By replaying real liquidation events from Aave v3 with different v4 settings, we demonstrate that simple parameter choices directly affect the amount of debt repaid, the attractiveness of liquidations to liquidators, and the protocol\u2019s revenue, including from SVR.</p>\n<p>Settings that favor borrowers result in smaller, less aggressive liquidations. This improves the experience for users whose positions are liquidated, but it also reduces incentives for liquidators and diminishes the surplus the protocol can capture. While this approach may perform well under stable market conditions, it can make liquidations less reliable during periods of high volatility.</p>\n<p>In contrast, settings that prioritise liquidation efficiency make liquidations more appealing to execute, even in stressed markets. These configurations result in larger liquidations and higher protocol revenue, but they also mean more forceful action against borrowers once their positions become undercollateralized.</p>\n<p>The main takeaway is that there is no single \u201cright\u201d liquidation configuration. Aave v4 enables the DAO to tailor liquidation behavior at the spoke level by adjusting parameters. This flexibility enables balancing user experience, system safety, and protocol sustainability in ways that align with the risk profile and objectives of each spoke.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61434-disclosure-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61434-disclosure-19\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclosure</h1>\n<p>The full methodology, simulation code, and dataset are available upon request.</p>\n<p>TokenLogic did not receive any payment for this post.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61434-copyright-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61434-copyright-20\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Copyright</h1>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived via <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CC0</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/v4-spoke-liquidation-parameters-impact-on-revenue/23993\">Read full topic</a></p>\n          ",

By replaying real liquidation events from Aave v3 with different v4 settings, we demonstrate that simple parameter choices directly affect the amount of debt repaid, the attractiveness of liquidations to liquidators, and the protocol\u2019s revenue, including from SVR.</p>\n<p>Settings that favor borrowers result in smaller, less aggressive liquidations. This improves the experience for users whose positions are liquidated, but it also reduces incentives for liquidators and diminishes the surplus the protocol can capture. While this approach may perform well under stable market conditions, it can make liquidations less reliable during periods of high volatility.</p>\n<p>In contrast, settings that prioritise liquidation efficiency make liquidations more appealing to execute, even in stressed markets. These configurations result in larger liquidations and higher protocol revenue, but they also mean more forceful action against borrowers once their positions become undercollateralized.</p>\n<p>The main takeaway is that there is no single \u201cright\u201d liquidation configuration. Aave v4 enables the DAO to tailor liquidation behavior at the spoke level by adjusting parameters. This flexibility enables balancing user experience, system safety, and protocol sustainability in ways that align with the risk profile and objectives of each spoke.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61434-disclosure-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61434-disclosure-19\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclosure</h1>\n<p>The full methodology, simulation code, and dataset are available upon request.</p>\n<p>TokenLogic did not receive any payment for this post.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61434-copyright-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61434-copyright-20\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Copyright</h1>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived via <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CC0</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/v4-spoke-liquidation-parameters-impact-on-revenue/23993\">Read full topic</a></p>\n          ",

A convergence of geopolitical escalation in the Middle East, a temporary United States government funding lapse, and a historic drawdown in precious metals such as gold or silver cascaded into the crypto markets during thin weekend trading hours. Bitcoin fell from $84,000 to below $77,000 and Ethereum dropped to $2,300.
