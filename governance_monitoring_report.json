      "description": "\n            <h1><a name=\"p-61208-overview-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-overview-1\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Overview</h1>\n<p>The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate and propose the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes for WETH, cbBTC, and WBTC on Aave v3. These configurations are designed to allow users to opt into a borrowing environment where supplied collateral is not rehypothecated, thereby eliminating liquidity and liquidation execution risk arising from rehypothecation, removing borrower exposure to counterparty default risk, and enabling more competitive risk parameterization.</p>\n<p>Historically, Aave has mostly relied on a pooled collateral model in which supplied assets are rehypothecated to support capital efficient lending markets. This design has formed the foundation of Aave\u2019s growth and remains the dominant structure across onchain lending today. In parallel, relatively small but steadily growing segment of onchain lending has emerged around segregated collateral models, where supplied assets are escrowed and never lent out to other borrowers. This approach has been particularly favored for bluechip collateral assets, such as BTC wrappers, where borrowers tend to prioritize risk isolation, predictable liquidity, and the elimination of counterparty exposure over maximizing supply yield.</p>\n<p>As onchain lending matures and borrower preferences diversify, supporting both pooled and segregated collateral experiences becomes increasingly important. Introducing segregated bluechip E-Modes allows Aave to participate in this growing segment, expand its addressable borrower base, and capture demand from users who prefer an escrowed collateral model, while preserving the existing pooled markets for users who continue to value capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>Our recommendation is to support the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes for WETH, cbBTC, and WBTC on Core, Arbitrum and Base instances as a complementary option to existing pooled markets. This approach expands the protocol design space without disrupting current users, improves risk segmentation, and allows Aave to better serve heterogeneous borrower preferences.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-terminology-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-terminology-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Terminology</strong></h1>\n<p>This section defines the core terminology used throughout the analysis to ensure a shared and consistent understanding of the concepts discussed. The distinction between segregated and pooled collateral models is central to this proposal, and clarifying these terms upfront is intended to avoid ambiguity and ensure that subsequent discussion, evaluation, and governance deliberation are grounded in a common conceptual framework.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-non-rehypothecated-collateral-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-non-rehypothecated-collateral-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Segregated (Non Rehypothecated) Collateral</h2>\n<p>Segregated collateral refers to a lending design in which supplied assets are escrowed and not lent out to other borrowers under any circumstances. Collateral supplied under this model remains fully segregated and continuously available, regardless of market utilization or borrowing activity elsewhere in the protocol.</p>\n<p>From the borrower perspective, this structure ensures that collateral can always be withdrawn immediately upon loan repayment, without dependency on external liquidity conditions. From the protocol and liquidator perspective, escrowed collateral is always available to facilitate timely liquidations when positions approach or breach required collateralization thresholds. As a result, liquidity availability for withdrawals and liquidation execution is guaranteed by design.</p>\n<p>The primary tradeoff of this model is reduced capital efficiency. Because escrowed collateral is not deployed elsewhere in the system, it does not generate yield for the supplier, and borrowing costs are not offset by supply side interest.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-pooled-rehypothecated-collateral-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-pooled-rehypothecated-collateral-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Pooled (Rehypothecated) Collateral</h2>\n<p>Pooled collateral refers to the traditional lending model used by Aave and most onchain money markets, where supplied assets are pooled and made available for borrowing by other users. In this structure, collateral backing a loan is not held idle but is instead lent out within the protocol to support additional borrowing activity.</p>\n<p>This design enables higher capital efficiency by allowing supplied assets to generate yield, which in turn lowers net borrowing costs for users and supports deeper, more liquid markets across multiple asset pairs. Pooled collateral models are therefore well suited for users who value yield generation and capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>However, because collateral is actively deployed, its availability is subject to overall market utilization. In periods of high utilization, collateral may not be immediately withdrawable, and liquidation execution relies on sufficient available liquidity within the pool. As a result, lenders and the protocol implicitly take on additional liquidity and counterparty exposure relative to segregated collateral models, all else being equal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-motivation-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The onchain lending market has reached a meaningful scale, with total active loans across chains and lending protocols amounting to approximately $36.7 billion. The majority of this activity continues to be concentrated in pooled lending markets. Approximately 81% of total active loans, or roughly $30 billion, are issued against rehypothecated collateral structures.</p>\n<p>Within this segment, Aave represents the dominant share. Aave accounts for approximately 62% of total active onchain loans and roughly 76% of all loans issued against rehypothecated collateral. This highlights both Aave\u2019s central role in the pooled lending ecosystem and its strong product market fit for capital efficient, rehypothecated lending models.</p>\n<p>In contrast, lending activity backed by segregated, escrowed collateral remains smaller in absolute terms but is far from negligible. Active loans issued against segregated collateral currently total approximately $6.8 billion. While this represents a minority share of the overall lending market, it reflects a distinct and growing user preference for non rehypothecated collateral designs.</p>\n<p>Growth trends over the past year further reinforce this observation. Active loans issued through pooled lending protocols increased by approximately 56%, while active loans issued through segregated lending protocols increased by approximately 90% over the same period. The higher percentage growth observed in segregated lending is partly attributable to its smaller starting base. In absolute terms, however, pooled lending protocols, driven primarily by Aave, accounted for the larger share of net growth in active loans.</p>\n<p>Recent upgrades in Aave v3.6 introduce additional flexibility that enables clearer separation of collateral behaviors and more granular market configurations, making factual collateral segregation feasible where it was previously constrained. This expanded design space allows Aave to serve a broader range of borrower preferences without disrupting existing pooled markets.</p>\n<p>Taken together, these trends indicate that segregated collateral lending is evolving from a niche design into a meaningful and expanding segment of onchain credit markets. While pooled rehypothecated lending remains dominant, demand for escrowed collateral structures is growing steadily. The primary motivation for this proposal is therefore to enable Aave to participate in this segment, capture emerging demand, and extend its market leadership to users who prefer segregated collateral experiences, while continuing to support and preserve its core pooled lending markets.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b762a2adbc56cea92e84a543b8d06c4a6d4bd165.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qaiHyMNwsle7oXjWsVr7ME5p8Gh.png?dl=1\" title=\"image (3)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b762a2adbc56cea92e84a543b8d06c4a6d4bd165.png\" alt=\"image (3)\" data-base62-sha1=\"qaiHyMNwsle7oXjWsVr7ME5p8Gh\" width=\"1010\" height=\"725\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-high-level-design-and-implementation-approach-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-high-level-design-and-implementation-approach-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>High Level Design and Implementation Approach</h1>\n<p>This section outlines a high level design for enabling segregated bluechip collateral borrowing on Aave v3 without modifying the core pooled markets. The intent is to describe the conceptual mechanism from a risk management perspective, while leaving smart contract implementation details, security considerations, and final architectural decisions to relevant contributors.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-conceptual-architecture-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-conceptual-architecture-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conceptual Architecture</h2>\n<p>At a high level, the segregated collateral experience can be implemented by introducing wrapper assets for each targeted bluechip collateral. These wrapper assets are designed solely to represent escrowed collateral positions and to ensure that the underlying asset is not made available for borrowing.</p>\n<p><strong>Wrapper Contracts and Segregated Wrapper Assets</strong></p>\n<p>For each asset covered in this proposal, a dedicated wrapper contract would accept deposits of the underlying token and mint a corresponding segregated wrapper token (sToken) on a 1:1 basis.</p>\n<p>Examples include the following mappings.</p>\n<p>WETH to sWETH<br>\ncbBTC to scbBTC<br>\nWBTC to sWBTC</p>\n<p>The wrapper naming and symbols are illustrative and can be finalized during implementation. The core requirement is that each wrapper token is always and immediately redeemable for its underlying at a 1:1 rate, similar to the WETH9 implementation and with minimal functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>Aave v3 Listings and Collateral Configuration</strong></p>\n<p>The segregated wrapper assets would then be listed on Aave v3 as collateral and configured as non-borrowable. This configuration ensures that the supplied collateral cannot be borrowed by other users, which is the central property required to prevent rehypothecation.</p>\n<p>From the user perspective, supplying the segregated wrapper asset should function similarly to supplying any other collateral, with the distinction that the supplied balance is not part of the borrowable liquidity pool and is only usable as collateral within its designated E-Mode category.</p>\n<p><strong>E-Mode Configuration and Stablecoin Access</strong></p>\n<p>To preserve existing liquidity and user experience for stablecoin borrowing, the proposal relies on E-Mode categories that allow segregated wrapper collateral to access the existing core stablecoin markets.</p>\n<p>Concretely, the design would introduce dedicated E-Mode categories that include the segregated wrapper collateral assets and the relevant stablecoin borrow assets already listed on the instance.</p>\n<p>This approach allows segregated collateral users to borrow from the existing deep stablecoin reserves.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-user-flow-and-integration-at-a-high-level-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-user-flow-and-integration-at-a-high-level-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>User Flow and Integration at a High Level</h2>\n<p>From a user flow perspective, the mechanism can be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p>A user who opts into the segregated pathway deposits WETH, cbBTC, or WBTC. The corresponding wrapper contract receives the deposited asset and mints a segregated wrapper token (sToken) on a 1:1 basis. The minted sToken is then supplied to Aave on behalf of the user, where it functions exclusively as collateral in E-mode and cannot be borrowed by other participants.</p>\n<p>When the user repays their debt and withdraws collateral, the flow reverses. The wrapper token is withdrawn from Aave, burned in exchange for the underlying, and the underlying token is returned to the user.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-pricing-and-oracle-considerations-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-pricing-and-oracle-considerations-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Pricing and Oracle Considerations</h2>\n<p>The segregated wrapper assets are intended to maintain strict 1:1 parity with their underlying tokens, as they are simple proxy contracts. As a result, the wrapper assets should be priced identically to their underlying assets. This can be achieved by reusing the existing oracle configuration for the underlying assets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-user-experience-and-interface-considerations-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-user-experience-and-interface-considerations-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>User Experience and Interface Considerations</h1>\n<p>The introduction of segregated bluechip collaterals is intended to have minimal impact on the existing Aave user experience and interface. The proposal is designed to extend current functionality rather than alter existing workflows, ensuring that users who prefer pooled markets can continue interacting with the protocol without disruption.</p>\n<p>From a frontend perspective, the segregated wrapper assets (sTokens) would be listed alongside existing assets in the Aave interface, following the same conventions used for other listed tokens. Each wrapper asset would be clearly labeled to reflect its segregated nature, for example sWETH \u2013 Segregated Wrapped Ether, scbBTC \u2013 Segregated Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin, and sWBTC \u2013 Segregated Wrapped Bitcoin. This naming convention is intended to provide immediate clarity to users regarding the collateral treatment of these assets.</p>\n<p>User interaction flows would remain consistent with current behavior. Supplying segregated collateral, entering the relevant E-Mode, borrowing stablecoins, and managing positions would follow the same steps and interface patterns already familiar to Aave users. The primary difference is the explicit choice at deposit time between supplying the underlying asset into the pooled market or into its segregated counterpart.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-risk-and-benefit-assessment-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-risk-and-benefit-assessment-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk and Benefit Assessment</strong></h1>\n<p>This section outlines the primary benefits and risks associated with the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes, with a focus on protocol level considerations, borrower outcomes, and potential second order effects.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-benefits-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-benefits-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Benefits</h3>\n<p>The proposal enables Aave v3 to directly participate in the growing segment of segregated collateral lending within the broader borrow lend ecosystem. While pooled lending remains dominant, segregated collateral borrowing is exhibiting sustained growth, and supporting this design allows Aave to capture incremental demand rather than ceding this segment to alternative protocols.</p>\n<p>Certainty around liquidity availability materially improves the risk profile of segregated collateral positions. Because collateral is escrowed and never rehypothecated, the protocol can safely support higher borrowing power through better LTV and LT configurations, improving competitiveness for borrowers.</p>\n<p>Guaranteed liquidity availability also ensures that liquidations are not halted or delayed during periods of market volatility due to elevated utilization. This removes a key execution risk present in pooled markets when market approaches full utilization levels and supports more predictable system behavior under stress.</p>\n<p>Lastly, borrowers using segregated collateral also avoid counterparty exposure to other borrowers. Since collateral is not lent out, borrowers are insulated from risks associated with third party defaults or liquidity shortfalls elsewhere in the protocol, resulting in a clearer and more contained risk profile.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-risks-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-risks-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risks</strong></h3>\n<p>The primary risk associated with this proposal relates to potential liquidity migration from pooled markets to segregated markets, particularly for ETH collateral. ETH is a highly utilized market and serves as foundational liquidity supporting large LST and LRT borrowing activity. A meaningful migration of existing ETH supply from pooled markets into segregated configurations could reduce available liquidity for LST and LRT markets and negatively impact overall protocol revenue.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this risk, segregated ETH E-Modes should be introduced with tighter initial supply caps relative to BTC based segregated configurations and monitored closely following deployment. This approach allows governance to observe whether segregated E-Modes are primarily attracting new borrowing demand or instead incentivizing migration of existing positions from pooled markets. Parameter adjustments and caps can then be iteratively refined based on observed usage patterns and their impact on broader market health.</p>\n<p>Overall, while the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes introduces a tradeoff between borrowing power, capital efficiency and risk isolation, the proposed design, combined with conservative rollout parameters and active monitoring, allows Aave to explore this design space without materially compromising the stability or profitability of existing pooled markets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-lt-configuration-considerations-for-segregated-markets-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-lt-configuration-considerations-for-segregated-markets-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>LT Configuration Considerations for Segregated Markets</strong></h1>\n<p>The recommended thresholds are outputs of Chaos Labs VaR-based simulation frameworks that evaluate downside price moves and liquidation feasibility under a range of market conditions, including stressed environments.</p>\n<p>While the specific modeling assumptions and parameterization are subject to refinement and implementation level review, the key calibration intuition is straightforward. In segregated configurations, collateral is escrowed and not rehypothecated, which improves certainty around collateral availability during liquidation events. In addition, collateral is segregated from pooled liquidity dynamics and is not cross margined with broader pool utilization, reducing reliance on external liquidity conditions for liquidation execution. Together, these factors meaningfully reduce liquidation execution risk and limit second-order effects that can arise when collateral is deployed elsewhere in the system.</p>\n<p>As a result, the protocol can support higher borrowing power for these assets relative to pooled configurations while maintaining conservative liquidation safety margins. The proposed LT values are therefore designed to reflect the improved predictability of liquidation execution and collateral accessibility in segregated markets, while still accounting for underlying price volatility, liquidity conditions of borrow assets, and the operational realities of liquidation execution.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-cross-margin-restrictions-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-cross-margin-restrictions-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Cross Margin Restrictions</strong></h1>\n<p>In historical implementations of E-Modes, the protocol fully isolated parameterized debt assets via the E-Mode mask; however, users could hypothetically add non-whitelisted collateral assets to the aggregate position and borrow E-Mode-whitelisted borrowable assets. This led to aggregated position health being dictated by an effectively cross-margined collateral position, complicating the dynamics surrounding factual isolation.</p>\n<p>With the launch of v3.6, there is now a practical path to pure isolation and to strictly preventing cross-margin within the proposed Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes. Specifically, any collateral asset that is not part of a given E-Mode is configured with a maximum LTV of 0 when that E-Mode is active. This ensures that users who already maintain cross-margin positions, where stablecoins are borrowed against a combination of wrapped bluechip and non bluechip collateral, cannot activate the Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode to improve their health factor, which is explicitly designed to operate without cross-margin exposure.</p>\n<p>Operationally, this requires enumerating all collateral assets that are outside the scope of each Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode and assigning them an LTV of 0 within that E-Mode. To avoid excessive table expansion and to maintain readability, these assets are grouped under an \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d category in the specification tables, with the full list disclosed in the section below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-16\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assets Configured as \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d</strong></h2>\n<p>The following lists of collateral assets that are configured with LTV0 within each Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-17\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Segregated ETH Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-18\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Segregated BTC Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WBTC, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, CBETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-recommendation-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-recommendation-19\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Recommendation</h1>\n<p>We recommend the introduction of segregated bluechip stablecoin E-Modes on Aave v3, supported by the listing of dedicated segregated wrapper assets and conservative initial configuration parameters.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we recommend listing segregated wrapper assets (sTokens) for bluechip collateral and enabling their use exclusively within dedicated segregated stablecoin E-Modes. This includes the listing of sWETH, scbBTC, and sWBTC, with each asset configured as non borrowable and usable as collateral only within its designated E-Mode.

These configurations are designed to allow users to opt into a borrowing environment where supplied collateral is not rehypothecated, thereby eliminating liquidity and liquidation execution risk arising from rehypothecation, removing borrower exposure to counterparty default risk, and enabling more competitive risk parameterization.</p>\n<p>Historically, Aave has mostly relied on a pooled collateral model in which supplied assets are rehypothecated to support capital efficient lending markets. This design has formed the foundation of Aave\u2019s growth and remains the dominant structure across onchain lending today. In parallel, relatively small but steadily growing segment of onchain lending has emerged around segregated collateral models, where supplied assets are escrowed and never lent out to other borrowers. This approach has been particularly favored for bluechip collateral assets, such as BTC wrappers, where borrowers tend to prioritize risk isolation, predictable liquidity, and the elimination of counterparty exposure over maximizing supply yield.</p>\n<p>As onchain lending matures and borrower preferences diversify, supporting both pooled and segregated collateral experiences becomes increasingly important. Introducing segregated bluechip E-Modes allows Aave to participate in this growing segment, expand its addressable borrower base, and capture demand from users who prefer an escrowed collateral model, while preserving the existing pooled markets for users who continue to value capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>Our recommendation is to support the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes for WETH, cbBTC, and WBTC on Core, Arbitrum and Base instances as a complementary option to existing pooled markets. This approach expands the protocol design space without disrupting current users, improves risk segmentation, and allows Aave to better serve heterogeneous borrower preferences.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-terminology-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-terminology-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Terminology</strong></h1>\n<p>This section defines the core terminology used throughout the analysis to ensure a shared and consistent understanding of the concepts discussed. The distinction between segregated and pooled collateral models is central to this proposal, and clarifying these terms upfront is intended to avoid ambiguity and ensure that subsequent discussion, evaluation, and governance deliberation are grounded in a common conceptual framework.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-non-rehypothecated-collateral-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-non-rehypothecated-collateral-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Segregated (Non Rehypothecated) Collateral</h2>\n<p>Segregated collateral refers to a lending design in which supplied assets are escrowed and not lent out to other borrowers under any circumstances. Collateral supplied under this model remains fully segregated and continuously available, regardless of market utilization or borrowing activity elsewhere in the protocol.</p>\n<p>From the borrower perspective, this structure ensures that collateral can always be withdrawn immediately upon loan repayment, without dependency on external liquidity conditions. From the protocol and liquidator perspective, escrowed collateral is always available to facilitate timely liquidations when positions approach or breach required collateralization thresholds. As a result, liquidity availability for withdrawals and liquidation execution is guaranteed by design.</p>\n<p>The primary tradeoff of this model is reduced capital efficiency. Because escrowed collateral is not deployed elsewhere in the system, it does not generate yield for the supplier, and borrowing costs are not offset by supply side interest.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-pooled-rehypothecated-collateral-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-pooled-rehypothecated-collateral-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Pooled (Rehypothecated) Collateral</h2>\n<p>Pooled collateral refers to the traditional lending model used by Aave and most onchain money markets, where supplied assets are pooled and made available for borrowing by other users. In this structure, collateral backing a loan is not held idle but is instead lent out within the protocol to support additional borrowing activity.</p>\n<p>This design enables higher capital efficiency by allowing supplied assets to generate yield, which in turn lowers net borrowing costs for users and supports deeper, more liquid markets across multiple asset pairs. Pooled collateral models are therefore well suited for users who value yield generation and capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>However, because collateral is actively deployed, its availability is subject to overall market utilization. In periods of high utilization, collateral may not be immediately withdrawable, and liquidation execution relies on sufficient available liquidity within the pool. As a result, lenders and the protocol implicitly take on additional liquidity and counterparty exposure relative to segregated collateral models, all else being equal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-motivation-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The onchain lending market has reached a meaningful scale, with total active loans across chains and lending protocols amounting to approximately $36.7 billion. The majority of this activity continues to be concentrated in pooled lending markets. Approximately 81% of total active loans, or roughly $30 billion, are issued against rehypothecated collateral structures.</p>\n<p>Within this segment, Aave represents the dominant share. Aave accounts for approximately 62% of total active onchain loans and roughly 76% of all loans issued against rehypothecated collateral. This highlights both Aave\u2019s central role in the pooled lending ecosystem and its strong product market fit for capital efficient, rehypothecated lending models.</p>\n<p>In contrast, lending activity backed by segregated, escrowed collateral remains smaller in absolute terms but is far from negligible. Active loans issued against segregated collateral currently total approximately $6.8 billion. While this represents a minority share of the overall lending market, it reflects a distinct and growing user preference for non rehypothecated collateral designs.</p>\n<p>Growth trends over the past year further reinforce this observation. Active loans issued through pooled lending protocols increased by approximately 56%, while active loans issued through segregated lending protocols increased by approximately 90% over the same period. The higher percentage growth observed in segregated lending is partly attributable to its smaller starting base. In absolute terms, however, pooled lending protocols, driven primarily by Aave, accounted for the larger share of net growth in active loans.</p>\n<p>Recent upgrades in Aave v3.6 introduce additional flexibility that enables clearer separation of collateral behaviors and more granular market configurations, making factual collateral segregation feasible where it was previously constrained. This expanded design space allows Aave to serve a broader range of borrower preferences without disrupting existing pooled markets.</p>\n<p>Taken together, these trends indicate that segregated collateral lending is evolving from a niche design into a meaningful and expanding segment of onchain credit markets. While pooled rehypothecated lending remains dominant, demand for escrowed collateral structures is growing steadily. The primary motivation for this proposal is therefore to enable Aave to participate in this segment, capture emerging demand, and extend its market leadership to users who prefer segregated collateral experiences, while continuing to support and preserve its core pooled lending markets.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b762a2adbc56cea92e84a543b8d06c4a6d4bd165.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qaiHyMNwsle7oXjWsVr7ME5p8Gh.png?dl=1\" title=\"image (3)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b762a2adbc56cea92e84a543b8d06c4a6d4bd165.png\" alt=\"image (3)\" data-base62-sha1=\"qaiHyMNwsle7oXjWsVr7ME5p8Gh\" width=\"1010\" height=\"725\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-high-level-design-and-implementation-approach-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-high-level-design-and-implementation-approach-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>High Level Design and Implementation Approach</h1>\n<p>This section outlines a high level design for enabling segregated bluechip collateral borrowing on Aave v3 without modifying the core pooled markets. The intent is to describe the conceptual mechanism from a risk management perspective, while leaving smart contract implementation details, security considerations, and final architectural decisions to relevant contributors.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-conceptual-architecture-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-conceptual-architecture-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conceptual Architecture</h2>\n<p>At a high level, the segregated collateral experience can be implemented by introducing wrapper assets for each targeted bluechip collateral. These wrapper assets are designed solely to represent escrowed collateral positions and to ensure that the underlying asset is not made available for borrowing.</p>\n<p><strong>Wrapper Contracts and Segregated Wrapper Assets</strong></p>\n<p>For each asset covered in this proposal, a dedicated wrapper contract would accept deposits of the underlying token and mint a corresponding segregated wrapper token (sToken) on a 1:1 basis.</p>\n<p>Examples include the following mappings.</p>\n<p>WETH to sWETH<br>\ncbBTC to scbBTC<br>\nWBTC to sWBTC</p>\n<p>The wrapper naming and symbols are illustrative and can be finalized during implementation. The core requirement is that each wrapper token is always and immediately redeemable for its underlying at a 1:1 rate, similar to the WETH9 implementation and with minimal functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>Aave v3 Listings and Collateral Configuration</strong></p>\n<p>The segregated wrapper assets would then be listed on Aave v3 as collateral and configured as non-borrowable. This configuration ensures that the supplied collateral cannot be borrowed by other users, which is the central property required to prevent rehypothecation.</p>\n<p>From the user perspective, supplying the segregated wrapper asset should function similarly to supplying any other collateral, with the distinction that the supplied balance is not part of the borrowable liquidity pool and is only usable as collateral within its designated E-Mode category.</p>\n<p><strong>E-Mode Configuration and Stablecoin Access</strong></p>\n<p>To preserve existing liquidity and user experience for stablecoin borrowing, the proposal relies on E-Mode categories that allow segregated wrapper collateral to access the existing core stablecoin markets.</p>\n<p>Concretely, the design would introduce dedicated E-Mode categories that include the segregated wrapper collateral assets and the relevant stablecoin borrow assets already listed on the instance.</p>\n<p>This approach allows segregated collateral users to borrow from the existing deep stablecoin reserves.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-user-flow-and-integration-at-a-high-level-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-user-flow-and-integration-at-a-high-level-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>User Flow and Integration at a High Level</h2>\n<p>From a user flow perspective, the mechanism can be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p>A user who opts into the segregated pathway deposits WETH, cbBTC, or WBTC. The corresponding wrapper contract receives the deposited asset and mints a segregated wrapper token (sToken) on a 1:1 basis. The minted sToken is then supplied to Aave on behalf of the user, where it functions exclusively as collateral in E-mode and cannot be borrowed by other participants.</p>\n<p>When the user repays their debt and withdraws collateral, the flow reverses. The wrapper token is withdrawn from Aave, burned in exchange for the underlying, and the underlying token is returned to the user.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-pricing-and-oracle-considerations-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-pricing-and-oracle-considerations-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Pricing and Oracle Considerations</h2>\n<p>The segregated wrapper assets are intended to maintain strict 1:1 parity with their underlying tokens, as they are simple proxy contracts. As a result, the wrapper assets should be priced identically to their underlying assets. This can be achieved by reusing the existing oracle configuration for the underlying assets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-user-experience-and-interface-considerations-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-user-experience-and-interface-considerations-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>User Experience and Interface Considerations</h1>\n<p>The introduction of segregated bluechip collaterals is intended to have minimal impact on the existing Aave user experience and interface. The proposal is designed to extend current functionality rather than alter existing workflows, ensuring that users who prefer pooled markets can continue interacting with the protocol without disruption.</p>\n<p>From a frontend perspective, the segregated wrapper assets (sTokens) would be listed alongside existing assets in the Aave interface, following the same conventions used for other listed tokens. Each wrapper asset would be clearly labeled to reflect its segregated nature, for example sWETH \u2013 Segregated Wrapped Ether, scbBTC \u2013 Segregated Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin, and sWBTC \u2013 Segregated Wrapped Bitcoin. This naming convention is intended to provide immediate clarity to users regarding the collateral treatment of these assets.</p>\n<p>User interaction flows would remain consistent with current behavior. Supplying segregated collateral, entering the relevant E-Mode, borrowing stablecoins, and managing positions would follow the same steps and interface patterns already familiar to Aave users. The primary difference is the explicit choice at deposit time between supplying the underlying asset into the pooled market or into its segregated counterpart.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-risk-and-benefit-assessment-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-risk-and-benefit-assessment-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk and Benefit Assessment</strong></h1>\n<p>This section outlines the primary benefits and risks associated with the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes, with a focus on protocol level considerations, borrower outcomes, and potential second order effects.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-benefits-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-benefits-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Benefits</h3>\n<p>The proposal enables Aave v3 to directly participate in the growing segment of segregated collateral lending within the broader borrow lend ecosystem. While pooled lending remains dominant, segregated collateral borrowing is exhibiting sustained growth, and supporting this design allows Aave to capture incremental demand rather than ceding this segment to alternative protocols.</p>\n<p>Certainty around liquidity availability materially improves the risk profile of segregated collateral positions. Because collateral is escrowed and never rehypothecated, the protocol can safely support higher borrowing power through better LTV and LT configurations, improving competitiveness for borrowers.</p>\n<p>Guaranteed liquidity availability also ensures that liquidations are not halted or delayed during periods of market volatility due to elevated utilization. This removes a key execution risk present in pooled markets when market approaches full utilization levels and supports more predictable system behavior under stress.</p>\n<p>Lastly, borrowers using segregated collateral also avoid counterparty exposure to other borrowers. Since collateral is not lent out, borrowers are insulated from risks associated with third party defaults or liquidity shortfalls elsewhere in the protocol, resulting in a clearer and more contained risk profile.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-risks-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-risks-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risks</strong></h3>\n<p>The primary risk associated with this proposal relates to potential liquidity migration from pooled markets to segregated markets, particularly for ETH collateral. ETH is a highly utilized market and serves as foundational liquidity supporting large LST and LRT borrowing activity. A meaningful migration of existing ETH supply from pooled markets into segregated configurations could reduce available liquidity for LST and LRT markets and negatively impact overall protocol revenue.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this risk, segregated ETH E-Modes should be introduced with tighter initial supply caps relative to BTC based segregated configurations and monitored closely following deployment. This approach allows governance to observe whether segregated E-Modes are primarily attracting new borrowing demand or instead incentivizing migration of existing positions from pooled markets. Parameter adjustments and caps can then be iteratively refined based on observed usage patterns and their impact on broader market health.</p>\n<p>Overall, while the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes introduces a tradeoff between borrowing power, capital efficiency and risk isolation, the proposed design, combined with conservative rollout parameters and active monitoring, allows Aave to explore this design space without materially compromising the stability or profitability of existing pooled markets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-lt-configuration-considerations-for-segregated-markets-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-lt-configuration-considerations-for-segregated-markets-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>LT Configuration Considerations for Segregated Markets</strong></h1>\n<p>The recommended thresholds are outputs of Chaos Labs VaR-based simulation frameworks that evaluate downside price moves and liquidation feasibility under a range of market conditions, including stressed environments.</p>\n<p>While the specific modeling assumptions and parameterization are subject to refinement and implementation level review, the key calibration intuition is straightforward. In segregated configurations, collateral is escrowed and not rehypothecated, which improves certainty around collateral availability during liquidation events. In addition, collateral is segregated from pooled liquidity dynamics and is not cross margined with broader pool utilization, reducing reliance on external liquidity conditions for liquidation execution. Together, these factors meaningfully reduce liquidation execution risk and limit second-order effects that can arise when collateral is deployed elsewhere in the system.</p>\n<p>As a result, the protocol can support higher borrowing power for these assets relative to pooled configurations while maintaining conservative liquidation safety margins. The proposed LT values are therefore designed to reflect the improved predictability of liquidation execution and collateral accessibility in segregated markets, while still accounting for underlying price volatility, liquidity conditions of borrow assets, and the operational realities of liquidation execution.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-cross-margin-restrictions-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-cross-margin-restrictions-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Cross Margin Restrictions</strong></h1>\n<p>In historical implementations of E-Modes, the protocol fully isolated parameterized debt assets via the E-Mode mask; however, users could hypothetically add non-whitelisted collateral assets to the aggregate position and borrow E-Mode-whitelisted borrowable assets. This led to aggregated position health being dictated by an effectively cross-margined collateral position, complicating the dynamics surrounding factual isolation.</p>\n<p>With the launch of v3.6, there is now a practical path to pure isolation and to strictly preventing cross-margin within the proposed Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes. Specifically, any collateral asset that is not part of a given E-Mode is configured with a maximum LTV of 0 when that E-Mode is active. This ensures that users who already maintain cross-margin positions, where stablecoins are borrowed against a combination of wrapped bluechip and non bluechip collateral, cannot activate the Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode to improve their health factor, which is explicitly designed to operate without cross-margin exposure.</p>\n<p>Operationally, this requires enumerating all collateral assets that are outside the scope of each Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode and assigning them an LTV of 0 within that E-Mode. To avoid excessive table expansion and to maintain readability, these assets are grouped under an \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d category in the specification tables, with the full list disclosed in the section below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-16\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assets Configured as \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d</strong></h2>\n<p>The following lists of collateral assets that are configured with LTV0 within each Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-17\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Segregated ETH Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-18\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Segregated BTC Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WBTC, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, CBETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-recommendation-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-recommendation-19\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Recommendation</h1>\n<p>We recommend the introduction of segregated bluechip stablecoin E-Modes on Aave v3, supported by the listing of dedicated segregated wrapper assets and conservative initial configuration parameters.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we recommend listing segregated wrapper assets (sTokens) for bluechip collateral and enabling their use exclusively within dedicated segregated stablecoin E-Modes.

These E-Modes are designed to enable stablecoin borrowing under a isolated risk parameterization.</p>\n<p>By isolating stablecoin borrowing within dedicated E-Modes, the protocol can offer improved capital efficiency for borrowers without expanding exposure beyond stablecoin debt against bluechip collateral assets. The flexibility introduced in v3.6 allows these E-Mode configurations to be adjusted or deprecated if conditions deteriorate, without impacting the underlying market parameterization or broader risk profile of the base asset markets.</p>\n<p>This approach aligns with a protocol wide risk posture, balancing enhanced borrower efficiency with clearer risk boundaries.</p>\n<p>On Base, where a cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode with matching risk parameters already exists, the proposal modifies the existing E-Mode rather than creating a new one.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-rationale-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-rationale-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>Across major Aave v3 deployments, the primary use case for WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC as collateral is stablecoin borrowing.</p>\n<p>On Ethereum mainnet, more than 95% of the borrowing activity backed by WETH is denominated in stablecoins, primarily USDT and USDC. In addition, the majority of WETH suppliers use WETH as their sole collateral asset and do not opt into cross margin exposure within the Core market.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9b52836abf43a825a8224b666c19654c4f036936.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ma2N6gd8uYcvPur8tryOnqNCsuy.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9b52836abf43a825a8224b666c19654c4f036936.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ma2N6gd8uYcvPur8tryOnqNCsuy\" width=\"620\" height=\"430\"></a></div><br>\nBorrow Against Distribution of WETH - Core Market<p></p>\n<p>A similar pattern is observed for WBTC and cbBTC.

By constraining borrowing to stablecoins while maintaining access to deep stablecoin markets for these bluechip collaterals, these E-Modes can support higher capital efficiency for borrowers without introducing additional exposure to reflexive debt.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-cross-margin-restrictions-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-cross-margin-restrictions-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Cross Margin Restrictions</strong></h1>\n<p>In historical implementations of E-Modes, the protocol fully isolated parameterized debt assets via the E-Mode mask; however, users could hypothetically add non-whitelisted collateral assets to the aggregate position and borrow E-Mode-whitelisted borrowable assets. This led to aggregated position health being dictated by an effectively cross-margined collateral position, complicating the dynamics surrounding factual isolation.</p>\n<p>With the launch of v3.6, there is now a practical path to pure isolation and to strictly preventing cross-margin within the proposed Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes. Specifically, any collateral asset that is not part of a given E-Mode is configured with a maximum LTV of 0 when that E-Mode is active. This ensures that users who already maintain cross-margin positions, where stablecoins are borrowed against a combination of wrapped bluechip and non bluechip collateral, cannot activate the Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode to improve their health factor, which is explicitly designed to operate without cross-margin exposure.</p>\n<p>Operationally, this requires enumerating all collateral assets that are outside the scope of each Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode and assigning them an LTV of 0 within that E-Mode. To avoid excessive table expansion and to maintain readability, these assets are grouped under an \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d category in the specification tables, with the full list disclosed in the section below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assets Configured as \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d</strong></h2>\n<p>The following lists of collateral assets that are configured with LTV0 within each Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61209-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>ETH Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WSTETH, WBTC, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Avalanche</strong><br>\nEURC, DAI.e, BTC.b, WAVAX, USDE, SUSDE, AUSD, LINK.e, AAVE.e, WBTC.e, sAVAX</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>CBETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61209-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>BTC Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE, EZETH</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-modification-of-the-existing-cbbtc-e-mode-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-modification-of-the-existing-cbbtc-e-mode-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Modification of the Existing cbBTC E-Mode</strong></h1>\n<p>For all deployments covered in this proposal, new Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes are introduced. The sole exception is the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode on Base, where an equivalent E-Mode already exists with matching risk parameters. In this case, the proposal does not introduce a new E-Mode, but instead modifies the existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode to achieve strict collateral isolation.</p>\n<p>The existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode on Base allows stablecoin borrowing against cbBTC with an LT of 83%. However, collateral assets outside the E-Mode are not currently subject to the LTV0 rule, which permits users to maintain cross-margin positions by combining cbBTC with other collateral assets. Creating a new E-Mode to enforce collateral isolation would require migrating existing user debt, which would introduce unnecessary friction and negatively impact user experience.</p>\n<p>Instead, this proposal preserves the existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode and its parameters, while extending the configuration to include all non E-Mode collateral assets with LTV set to 0. This change enforces true collateral isolation without requiring any migration of existing positions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-impact-on-existing-cross-margin-positions-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-impact-on-existing-cross-margin-positions-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Impact on Existing Cross-Margin Positions</strong></h2>\n<p>For users who currently have the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode active while also supplying additional collateral assets outside of the E-Mode, the following mechanics apply after the modification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All collateral assets outside of the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode will be added to the E-Mode with maximum LTV set to 0.</li>\n<li>These assets will inherit the E-Mode LT of 83%.</li>\n<li>Health Factor may increase, as some of these assets has reserve level LT below 83%.</li>\n<li>Borrowing power will not increase, since the LTV0 rule.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Importantly, while Health Factor may improve, users will not be able to increase borrowing. To fully exit such positions, users must first remove collateral assets with LTV0 before withdrawing cbBTC, which preserves the intended non cross-margin structure of the E-Mode.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-assessment-of-existing-cross-margin-exposure-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-assessment-of-existing-cross-margin-exposure-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assessment of Existing Cross-Margin Exposure</strong></h2>\n<p>An assessment of current positions on Base indicates that the amount of collateral supplied outside of cbBTC in cross-margin positions with an active cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode is limited.</p>\n<p>In aggregate, approximately $3M of non cbBTC collateral is supplied across these positions. Of this amount, roughly $2.7M consists of ETH, which already carries a LT of 83% outside of E-Mode.

These E-Modes are designed to enable stablecoin borrowing under a isolated risk parameterization.</p>\n<p>By isolating stablecoin borrowing within dedicated E-Modes, the protocol can offer improved capital efficiency for borrowers without expanding exposure beyond stablecoin debt against bluechip collateral assets. The flexibility introduced in v3.6 allows these E-Mode configurations to be adjusted or deprecated if conditions deteriorate, without impacting the underlying market parameterization or broader risk profile of the base asset markets.</p>\n<p>This approach aligns with a protocol wide risk posture, balancing enhanced borrower efficiency with clearer risk boundaries.</p>\n<p>On Base, where a cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode with matching risk parameters already exists, the proposal modifies the existing E-Mode rather than creating a new one.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-rationale-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-rationale-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>Across major Aave v3 deployments, the primary use case for WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC as collateral is stablecoin borrowing.</p>\n<p>On Ethereum mainnet, more than 95% of the borrowing activity backed by WETH is denominated in stablecoins, primarily USDT and USDC. In addition, the majority of WETH suppliers use WETH as their sole collateral asset and do not opt into cross margin exposure within the Core market.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9b52836abf43a825a8224b666c19654c4f036936.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ma2N6gd8uYcvPur8tryOnqNCsuy.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9b52836abf43a825a8224b666c19654c4f036936.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ma2N6gd8uYcvPur8tryOnqNCsuy\" width=\"620\" height=\"430\"></a></div><br>\nBorrow Against Distribution of WETH - Core Market<p></p>\n<p>A similar pattern is observed for WBTC and cbBTC. Borrowing activity backed by WBTC on Core markets exceeds 95% in stablecoins, while cbBTC exhibits a stablecoin borrowing share above 90%. These patterns indicate that volatile asset borrowing is not a material driver of demand for bluechip collateral, and that stablecoin access represents the dominant and persistent use case.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/f6ee7b1ae099551c34698149471ae3641f35c5d5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zesoQ7MlPfCYf9lfQ1gdLz1NfxP.png?dl=1\" title=\"image (1)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/f6ee7b1ae099551c34698149471ae3641f35c5d5.png\" alt=\"image (1)\" data-base62-sha1=\"zesoQ7MlPfCYf9lfQ1gdLz1NfxP\" width=\"619\" height=\"432\"></a></div><br>\nBorrow Against Distribution of WBTC- Core Market<p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/ee8c16e73d5c9e2468ddec32ec8959a2b1d3ceb0.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/y2hMfDXHt5mxm6Yuq0zPR89Xp7y.png?dl=1\" title=\"image (2)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/ee8c16e73d5c9e2468ddec32ec8959a2b1d3ceb0.png\" alt=\"image (2)\" data-base62-sha1=\"y2hMfDXHt5mxm6Yuq0zPR89Xp7y\" width=\"623\" height=\"424\"></a></div><br>\nBorrow Against Distribution of cbBTC- Core Market<p></p>\n<p>Given this observed behavior, introducing isolated stablecoin E-Modes allows the protocol to better align risk parameterization with actual usage. By constraining borrowing to stablecoins while maintaining access to deep stablecoin markets for these bluechip collaterals, these E-Modes can support higher capital efficiency for borrowers without introducing additional exposure to reflexive debt.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-cross-margin-restrictions-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-cross-margin-restrictions-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Cross Margin Restrictions</strong></h1>\n<p>In historical implementations of E-Modes, the protocol fully isolated parameterized debt assets via the E-Mode mask; however, users could hypothetically add non-whitelisted collateral assets to the aggregate position and borrow E-Mode-whitelisted borrowable assets. This led to aggregated position health being dictated by an effectively cross-margined collateral position, complicating the dynamics surrounding factual isolation.</p>\n<p>With the launch of v3.6, there is now a practical path to pure isolation and to strictly preventing cross-margin within the proposed Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes. Specifically, any collateral asset that is not part of a given E-Mode is configured with a maximum LTV of 0 when that E-Mode is active. This ensures that users who already maintain cross-margin positions, where stablecoins are borrowed against a combination of wrapped bluechip and non bluechip collateral, cannot activate the Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode to improve their health factor, which is explicitly designed to operate without cross-margin exposure.</p>\n<p>Operationally, this requires enumerating all collateral assets that are outside the scope of each Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode and assigning them an LTV of 0 within that E-Mode. To avoid excessive table expansion and to maintain readability, these assets are grouped under an \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d category in the specification tables, with the full list disclosed in the section below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assets Configured as \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d</strong></h2>\n<p>The following lists of collateral assets that are configured with LTV0 within each Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61209-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>ETH Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WSTETH, WBTC, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Avalanche</strong><br>\nEURC, DAI.e, BTC.b, WAVAX, USDE, SUSDE, AUSD, LINK.e, AAVE.e, WBTC.e, sAVAX</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>CBETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61209-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>BTC Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE, EZETH</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-modification-of-the-existing-cbbtc-e-mode-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-modification-of-the-existing-cbbtc-e-mode-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Modification of the Existing cbBTC E-Mode</strong></h1>\n<p>For all deployments covered in this proposal, new Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes are introduced. The sole exception is the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode on Base, where an equivalent E-Mode already exists with matching risk parameters. In this case, the proposal does not introduce a new E-Mode, but instead modifies the existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode to achieve strict collateral isolation.</p>\n<p>The existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode on Base allows stablecoin borrowing against cbBTC with an LT of 83%. However, collateral assets outside the E-Mode are not currently subject to the LTV0 rule, which permits users to maintain cross-margin positions by combining cbBTC with other collateral assets. Creating a new E-Mode to enforce collateral isolation would require migrating existing user debt, which would introduce unnecessary friction and negatively impact user experience.</p>\n<p>Instead, this proposal preserves the existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode and its parameters, while extending the configuration to include all non E-Mode collateral assets with LTV set to 0. This change enforces true collateral isolation without requiring any migration of existing positions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-impact-on-existing-cross-margin-positions-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-impact-on-existing-cross-margin-positions-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Impact on Existing Cross-Margin Positions</strong></h2>\n<p>For users who currently have the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode active while also supplying additional collateral assets outside of the E-Mode, the following mechanics apply after the modification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All collateral assets outside of the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode will be added to the E-Mode with maximum LTV set to 0.</li>\n<li>These assets will inherit the E-Mode LT of 83%.</li>\n<li>Health Factor may increase, as some of these assets has reserve level LT below 83%.</li>\n<li>Borrowing power will not increase, since the LTV0 rule.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Importantly, while Health Factor may improve, users will not be able to increase borrowing. To fully exit such positions, users must first remove collateral assets with LTV0 before withdrawing cbBTC, which preserves the intended non cross-margin structure of the E-Mode.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-assessment-of-existing-cross-margin-exposure-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-assessment-of-existing-cross-margin-exposure-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assessment of Existing Cross-Margin Exposure</strong></h2>\n<p>An assessment of current positions on Base indicates that the amount of collateral supplied outside of cbBTC in cross-margin positions with an active cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode is limited.</p>\n<p>In aggregate, approximately $3M of non cbBTC collateral is supplied across these positions. Of this amount, roughly $2.7M consists of ETH, which already carries a LT of 83% outside of E-Mode. As a result, the majority of these positions will experience no material change in Health Factor following the modification.</p>\n<p>The remaining exposure is distributed across a small set of assets with lower reserve level LT, as summarized below.</p>\n<p><strong>Non cbBTC Collateral in Active Cross-Margin Positions</strong><br>\n<em>(Base cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode)</em></p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Asset</th>\n<th>Collateral Amount (USD)</th>\n<th>Old LT</th>\n<th>New LT</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>WETH</td>\n<td>2,695,633</td>\n<td>83%</td>\n<td>83%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>wstETH</td>\n<td>127,255</td>\n<td>79%</td>\n<td>83%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>cbETH</td>\n<td>69,284</td>\n<td>79%</td>\n<td>83%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>61,442</td>\n<td>78%</td>\n<td>83%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>weETH</td>\n<td>34,022</td>\n<td>77%</td>\n<td>83%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>AAVE</td>\n<td>5,513</td>\n<td>65%</td>\n<td>83%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>ezETH</td>\n<td>3,171</td>\n<td>0%</td>\n<td>83%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>LBTC</td>\n<td>459</td>\n<td>73%</td>\n<td>83%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>tBTC</td>\n<td>7</td>\n<td>78%</td>\n<td>83%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h1><a name=\"p-61209-recommendation-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-recommendation-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Recommendation</h1>\n<p>Chaos Labs recommends the introduction of dedicated stablecoin E-Modes for WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC across Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, and Avalanche, with parameters calibrated to reflect observed borrowing behavior and onchain liquidity conditions.

Summary</h2>\n<p>This proposal introduces <strong>Maxshot AI</strong> to the Aave community as a complementary, value-accretive yield optimization and distribution layer.</p>\n<p>As Maxshot is already integrated with Aave V3 markets across multiple chains, this proposal does <strong>not</strong> request any protocol parameter changes, risk parameter updates, or direct integrations. Instead, it seeks community awareness, feedback, and formal ecosystem recognition of Maxshot as a third-party strategy operator that enhances capital efficiency and user experience for Aave.</p>\n<p>By leveraging AI-driven, non-discretionary agents, Maxshot simplifies access to optimized, omni-chain yield opportunities, with the goal of increasing total value locked (TVL), capital efficiency, and liquidity stickiness across Aave markets.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2. Abstract</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI operates as an intelligent yield optimization layer built on top of Aave and other DeFi protocols.

Summary</h2>\n<p>This proposal introduces <strong>Maxshot AI</strong> to the Aave community as a complementary, value-accretive yield optimization and distribution layer.</p>\n<p>As Maxshot is already integrated with Aave V3 markets across multiple chains, this proposal does <strong>not</strong> request any protocol parameter changes, risk parameter updates, or direct integrations. Instead, it seeks community awareness, feedback, and formal ecosystem recognition of Maxshot as a third-party strategy operator that enhances capital efficiency and user experience for Aave.</p>\n<p>By leveraging AI-driven, non-discretionary agents, Maxshot simplifies access to optimized, omni-chain yield opportunities, with the goal of increasing total value locked (TVL), capital efficiency, and liquidity stickiness across Aave markets.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2. Abstract</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI operates as an intelligent yield optimization layer built on top of Aave and other DeFi protocols. It automatically routes and rebalances capital across chains and markets using deterministic, AI-driven agents to maximize risk-adjusted returns.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to align the Aave community with an existing ecosystem partner that already contributes capital flows into Aave liquidity pools and improves user access to yield opportunities without introducing additional protocol risk.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3. Motivation</h2>\n<p>Aave is a foundational DeFi liquidity protocol with robust risk management, transparent governance, and deployments across multiple networks. While its multi-chain expansion is a core strength, it also introduces structural inefficiencies that create opportunities for complementary, user-layer optimization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-challenges-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-challenges-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Key Challenges</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Fragmentation:</strong> Liquidity is distributed across multiple Aave deployments, requiring users to manually bridge assets, compare rates, and manage positions across chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> Actively managing positions across multiple markets and networks is time-intensive and costly, leading to suboptimal capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Uneven Utilization:</strong> Friction at the user layer can result in idle liquidity and inconsistent utilization across Aave markets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Maxshot\u2019s Role</h3>\n<p>Maxshot AI acts as a non-custodial, intelligent routing and optimization layer on top of Aave, improving capital efficiency and user experience through automated, rules-based yield optimization\u2014without modifying or competing with Aave\u2019s core protocol.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4. Specification: Maxshot Overview</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI Agent Factory, an AI-native, automation-first infrastructure layer designed to build, deploy, and coordinate autonomous agents for on-chain capital optimization.</p>\n<p>At its core, Maxshot provides a standardized framework for creating protocol-aware, risk-constrained AI agents that can observe market conditions, reason over strategy sets, and execute actions across DeFi systems. These agents operate continuously within predefined risk models and governance-aligned parameters, enabling scalable and transparent automation at the infrastructure level.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Key Characteristics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deterministic, Continuous Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Agents operate autonomously and continuously, responding to market changes without manual intervention. All decisions follow transparent, rules-based logic that is auditable and verifiable on-chain, eliminating discretionary risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Full On-Chain Transparency</strong></p>\n<p>Every allocation, rebalance, and performance metric is recorded on-chain and available for real-time community review, enabling ongoing verification of compliance and protocol impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Maxshot enforces a strict separation between optimization logic (Strategy Layer), safety constraints (Risk Layer), and on-chain interactions (Execution Layer). This design ensures that strategy decisions cannot bypass risk controls and that all actions remain auditable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first flagship product built on this framework is <strong>Maxshot Omni Yield Aggregator</strong>, an omni-chain, multi-protocol yield optimization system live across multiple blockchains. Powered by a coordinated network of autonomous agents, the aggregator dynamically allocates capital in real time rather than relying on static strategies or manual rebalancing.</p>\n<p>As the agent factory expands, Maxshot is designed to support new on-chain use cases beyond yield optimization, while maintaining strict alignment with protocol risk frameworks and ecosystem incentives.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>5. Technical Architecture</h2>\n<p>Maxshot follows a protocol-agnostic, modular architecture optimized for transparency, security, and auditability. The system consists of three distinct layers:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Strategy Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Defines optimization logic and allocation objectives by analyzing real-time market data across Aave and other protocols. It generates allocation recommendations but has no execution authority.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-risk-layer-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-risk-layer-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Acts as the system\u2019s safety guardrail, enforcing predefined constraints such as protocol, asset, and chain exposure limits. Any action that violates these rules is automatically blocked and logged for transparency.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-execution-layer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-execution-layer-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Execution Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Handles all on-chain operations, including deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing. Execution is deterministic and fully auditable, and only proceeds after Risk Layer approval.</p>\n<p>This three-layer architecture ensures that strategy optimization, risk management, and execution transparency are never compromised. Each layer operates independently, and no single layer has authority over the entire system. This design reduces the risk of catastrophic failures and ensures that the Aave community retains full visibility and control over Maxshot\u2019s operations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>6.

Summary</h2>\n<p>This proposal introduces <strong>Maxshot AI</strong> to the Aave community as a complementary, value-accretive yield optimization and distribution layer.</p>\n<p>As Maxshot is already integrated with Aave V3 markets across multiple chains, this proposal does <strong>not</strong> request any protocol parameter changes, risk parameter updates, or direct integrations. Instead, it seeks community awareness, feedback, and formal ecosystem recognition of Maxshot as a third-party strategy operator that enhances capital efficiency and user experience for Aave.</p>\n<p>By leveraging AI-driven, non-discretionary agents, Maxshot simplifies access to optimized, omni-chain yield opportunities, with the goal of increasing total value locked (TVL), capital efficiency, and liquidity stickiness across Aave markets.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2. Abstract</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI operates as an intelligent yield optimization layer built on top of Aave and other DeFi protocols. It automatically routes and rebalances capital across chains and markets using deterministic, AI-driven agents to maximize risk-adjusted returns.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to align the Aave community with an existing ecosystem partner that already contributes capital flows into Aave liquidity pools and improves user access to yield opportunities without introducing additional protocol risk.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3. Motivation</h2>\n<p>Aave is a foundational DeFi liquidity protocol with robust risk management, transparent governance, and deployments across multiple networks. While its multi-chain expansion is a core strength, it also introduces structural inefficiencies that create opportunities for complementary, user-layer optimization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-challenges-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-challenges-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Key Challenges</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Fragmentation:</strong> Liquidity is distributed across multiple Aave deployments, requiring users to manually bridge assets, compare rates, and manage positions across chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> Actively managing positions across multiple markets and networks is time-intensive and costly, leading to suboptimal capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Uneven Utilization:</strong> Friction at the user layer can result in idle liquidity and inconsistent utilization across Aave markets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Maxshot\u2019s Role</h3>\n<p>Maxshot AI acts as a non-custodial, intelligent routing and optimization layer on top of Aave, improving capital efficiency and user experience through automated, rules-based yield optimization\u2014without modifying or competing with Aave\u2019s core protocol.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4. Specification: Maxshot Overview</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI Agent Factory, an AI-native, automation-first infrastructure layer designed to build, deploy, and coordinate autonomous agents for on-chain capital optimization.</p>\n<p>At its core, Maxshot provides a standardized framework for creating protocol-aware, risk-constrained AI agents that can observe market conditions, reason over strategy sets, and execute actions across DeFi systems. These agents operate continuously within predefined risk models and governance-aligned parameters, enabling scalable and transparent automation at the infrastructure level.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Key Characteristics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deterministic, Continuous Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Agents operate autonomously and continuously, responding to market changes without manual intervention. All decisions follow transparent, rules-based logic that is auditable and verifiable on-chain, eliminating discretionary risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Full On-Chain Transparency</strong></p>\n<p>Every allocation, rebalance, and performance metric is recorded on-chain and available for real-time community review, enabling ongoing verification of compliance and protocol impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Maxshot enforces a strict separation between optimization logic (Strategy Layer), safety constraints (Risk Layer), and on-chain interactions (Execution Layer). This design ensures that strategy decisions cannot bypass risk controls and that all actions remain auditable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first flagship product built on this framework is <strong>Maxshot Omni Yield Aggregator</strong>, an omni-chain, multi-protocol yield optimization system live across multiple blockchains. Powered by a coordinated network of autonomous agents, the aggregator dynamically allocates capital in real time rather than relying on static strategies or manual rebalancing.</p>\n<p>As the agent factory expands, Maxshot is designed to support new on-chain use cases beyond yield optimization, while maintaining strict alignment with protocol risk frameworks and ecosystem incentives.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>5. Technical Architecture</h2>\n<p>Maxshot follows a protocol-agnostic, modular architecture optimized for transparency, security, and auditability. The system consists of three distinct layers:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Strategy Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Defines optimization logic and allocation objectives by analyzing real-time market data across Aave and other protocols. It generates allocation recommendations but has no execution authority.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-risk-layer-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-risk-layer-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Acts as the system\u2019s safety guardrail, enforcing predefined constraints such as protocol, asset, and chain exposure limits. Any action that violates these rules is automatically blocked and logged for transparency.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-execution-layer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-execution-layer-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Execution Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Handles all on-chain operations, including deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing. Execution is deterministic and fully auditable, and only proceeds after Risk Layer approval.</p>\n<p>This three-layer architecture ensures that strategy optimization, risk management, and execution transparency are never compromised. Each layer operates independently, and no single layer has authority over the entire system. This design reduces the risk of catastrophic failures and ensures that the Aave community retains full visibility and control over Maxshot\u2019s operations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>6. Rationale &amp; Differentiation</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI-native, automation-native financial infrastructure designed to manage and optimize on-chain financial activities.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional yield aggregators that rely on static strategies or manual rebalancing, Maxshot operates as a network of non-discretionary, autonomous agents that continuously evaluate market conditions and execute allocation decisions in real time, strictly within predefined risk constraints and governance-aligned parameters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-core-advantages-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-core-advantages-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Core Advantages</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Omni-chain, Multi-protocol Optimization</strong></p>\n<p>Capital is optimized globally across chains and protocols rather than siloed within a single deployment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Agent-driven (Non-discretionary) Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Deterministic agents execute strategies continuously without human intervention or discretionary decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Strategy, Risk, and Execution</strong></p>\n<p>A modular architecture enforces clear boundaries between optimization logic, risk controls, and execution, enhancing security, transparency, and independent auditability.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This architecture allows Maxshot to function not merely as a yield aggregator, but as a general-purpose AI agent platform, where additional agents (such as risk agents, liquidity routing agents, governance-aware execution agents, and protocol-specific strategy agents) can be composed and deployed over time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>7. Live Deployments &amp; Metrics</h2>\n<p>Maxshot has been live in production since December 2025, and has already attracted meaningful TVL, demonstrating operational readiness and early market validation.</p>\n<p>The platform currently manages approximately $9.8M in total TVL across live deployments, including ~$1.8M in the Omni USDC vault.

This is achieved through the use of fully isolated markets, where collateral is never rehypothecated, and as such, liquidity risk is fully mitigated in the context of both withdrawals and liquidations.</p>\n<p>This analysis examines how these architectural choices can be applied to bluechip collateral.<br>\nIn this context, bluechip collateral refers specifically to WETH, WBTC and cbBTC. We outline multiple potential bluechip market designs ranging from the traditional pooled model to fully isolated collateral environments. Each design serves a different borrower and lender risk profile and presents a distinct combination of borrowing power, liquidity considerations, counterparty exposure and risk parameter flexibility.</p>\n<p><strong>What this analysis is NOT intended to cover</strong></p>\n<p>This document does not evaluate or make recommendations regarding which assets should be listed on Aave v4. It also does not provide guidance on risk parameterization for wide range of assets. Finally, this analysis does not examine how hubs and spokes should be configured for non bluechip collateral. The scope is purposefully limited to the design space for WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC within Aave v4, in order to start a focused technical discussion before extending the framework to a broader set of assets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-60984-market-designs-for-bluechip-collateral-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-60984-market-designs-for-bluechip-collateral-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Market Designs for Bluechip Collateral</h1>\n<p>This section presents the full range of market design choices available for bluechip collateral. We outline each configuration individually and describe its native implementation under the Aave v4 infrastructure. Furthermore, we cover each configuration\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, focusing on borrowing power, liquidity considerations, counterparty exposure, and parameter flexibility. After examining the designs one by one, we consolidate their features into a comparative analysis table to provide a clear assessment. The section concludes with our recommended structure for bluechip assets, which aims to serve a broad spectrum of borrowers and lenders with different risk preferences while maintaining a unified liquidity environment and avoiding unnecessary fragmentation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-60984-h-1-pooled-core-spoke-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-60984-h-1-pooled-core-spoke-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>1- Pooled Core Spoke</h2>\n<p>The pooled Core Spoke represents the most general and widely accessible configuration within the hub and spoke framework. In this building block configuration, a broad set of collateral assets is combined into a single pooled environment that closely mirrors the structure of the current Aave v3 Core market. The shared collateral base enables cross collateralization across many asset types, which in turn necessitates the use of the most conservative risk parameters within the v4 design space.</p>\n<p>In this model, deposited assets are rehypothecated to generate yield based on borrower demand. Bluechip assets such as WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC are listed alongside other collateral assets, providing a familiar user experience and a risk profile that is consistent with the pooled model used today. This structure also benefits from direct access to the deepest stablecoin reserves in the protocol, which supports interest rate stability and ensures efficient borrowing conditions for users.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/6/6fc56c2793d4ad528a8abf8fdff345a68d99f40a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fWLYrD9x0erR8MUKv5UNHBVOchs.png?dl=1\" title=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/6/6fc56c2793d4ad528a8abf8fdff345a68d99f40a.png\" alt=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_1\" data-base62-sha1=\"fWLYrD9x0erR8MUKv5UNHBVOchs\" width=\"1175\" height=\"737\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-60984-h-2-bluechip-stablecoin-spoke-with-cross-margin-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-60984-h-2-bluechip-stablecoin-spoke-with-cross-margin-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2- Bluechip Stablecoin Spoke with Cross Margin</h2>\n<p>The bluechip stablecoin spoke is a dedicated configuration that allows WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC to be used as collateral to borrow stablecoins while retaining cross collateral functionality within the spoke. This structure creates a focused environment for pristine assets.</p>\n<p>The spoke continues to benefit from the deep stablecoin liquidity of the core hub, which supports rate stability and efficient borrowing conditions. Conceptually, it resembles the E Mode configuration in Aave v3, but with additional precision. As covered in our analysis <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v4-new-features-and-risk-parameter-analysis/23443\">Aave v4: New Features and Risk Parameter Analysis</a>, v4 introduces several spoke level parameters regarding how liquidation should work, including <code>targetHealthFactor</code>, <code>liquidationBonusFactor</code>, and <code>healthFactorForMaxBonus</code>. These can be tuned specifically for bluechip assets to offer a more protective liquidation environment for borrowers, reflecting their lower risk profile.</p>\n<p>Collateral within this spoke remains rehypothecated, enabling borrowers to earn a yield on their collateral. While bluechip assets can receive more favourable parameterization than in the general pooled environment, cross collateralization remains an important constraint. The volatility or utilization spike of one asset within the spoke affects the risk profile of the others during stress scenarios, which limits how aggressive the parameter settings can be. This interdependence prevents the collateral assets from reaching the more competitive risk settings achievable in segmented configurations that which we discuss in the following section.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/726dd7827340051ab167ac1f9bf824b77294ab9f.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gkhLx6ipkqO1yyWBxlxlafqOCo7.png?dl=1\" title=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/726dd7827340051ab167ac1f9bf824b77294ab9f.png\" alt=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_2\" data-base62-sha1=\"gkhLx6ipkqO1yyWBxlxlafqOCo7\" width=\"1175\" height=\"737\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-60984-h-3-bluechip-stablecoin-spokes-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-60984-h-3-bluechip-stablecoin-spokes-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3- Bluechip Stablecoin Spokes</h2>\n<p>Bluechip stablecoin spokes represent a more segmented configuration in which each pristine collateral asset is placed into its own dedicated spoke. Unlike the cross-margin design discussed earlier, this structure does not allow WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC to serve as collateral for one another. Each asset operates within an independent environment that maintains a clear separation of risk between collateral types.</p>\n<p>This configuration enables spoke-level liquidation parameters to be tailored to the specific characteristics of each individual blue-chip asset. Parameters can therefore be optimized in a more focused manner than in a cross-collateralized structure, where inter-asset volatility places limits on parameter flexibility.</p>\n<p>Collateral within these spokes continues to be rehypothecated, allowing borrowers to earn yield on their collateral based on utilization. Borrowers retain access to the deep stablecoin liquidity of the core hub, and the design does not introduce any liquidity fragmentation.</p>\n<p>The removal of cross-collateralization allows these spokes to support higher borrowing power compared to a shared blue-chip spoke. By separating the collateral assets from one another, the design reduces correlated risk transmission and enables more competitive parameterization.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/ee609e0ccdc50bab64efe99e0c6844a5f1913c2f.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/y0MDFdwIMJwUQgEftGtaIPlWr2D.png?dl=1\" title=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_3\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/ee609e0ccdc50bab64efe99e0c6844a5f1913c2f.png\" alt=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_3\" data-base62-sha1=\"y0MDFdwIMJwUQgEftGtaIPlWr2D\" width=\"1908\" height=\"737\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-60984-h-4-isolated-bluechip-stablecoin-spoke-with-cross-margin-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-60984-h-4-isolated-bluechip-stablecoin-spoke-with-cross-margin-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4- Isolated Bluechip Stablecoin Spoke with Cross Margin</h2>\n<p>The isolated setups introduce a separate hub and spoke structure dedicated solely to bluechip collateral, while still allowing cross collateralization between WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC. In this configuration, bluechip assets are not borrowable and their primary function within the hub is to serve as collateral for stablecoin borrowing.</p>\n<p>A defining feature of this design is the removal of rehypothecation. Collateral is never lent out within the isolated hub, which ensures that borrowers retain full and immediate access to their collateral at all times. As a result, borrowers are not exposed to liquidity risk during periods of elevated utilization. Furthermore, the borrowers do not underwrite the obligations of other borrowers, since the setup prevents collateral from being serviced to separate borrowing positions as debt. This eliminates solvency and default risk stemming from the behavior or risk profile of other borrowers.</p>\n<p>The absence of collateral utilization also strengthens the protocol\u2019s risk posture. Because the collateral is never deployed into lending activity, the hub maintains complete liquidity for liquidations under stress scenarios. This removes the risk of liquidations being halted due to limited available liquidity and ensures that the protocol can always execute liquidations when required. As a result, the structure supports meaningfully more competitive risk parameters, reflecting the reduced systemic risk within a fully isolated environment.</p>\n<p>This configuration is particularly well suited for borrowers who do not want their collateral to be rehypothecated and who value guaranteed availability of their deposited assets at all times. It is also an attractive environment for stablecoin suppliers who prefer to underwrite only pristine collateral and avoid exposure to a broader mix of assets.</p>\n<p>The seperate hub does introduce liquidity fragmentation, given that the isolated hub does not have direct access to the deep stablecoin liquidity of the Core Hub. This can be addressed by establishing credit lines from the Core Hub and/or through the reinvestment controller, which allows idle stable liquidity from the Core to be allocated to the Isolated Hub when needed. Both approaches come with trade offs and operational considerations that require separate and detailed analysis beyond the scope of this work.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/4/4b7aea897100c785ce3e8b3b3677d194d24563d7.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/aLJ9JhuY9K3HKLMsjYPf9lJ55Nt.png?dl=1\" title=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/4/4b7aea897100c785ce3e8b3b3677d194d24563d7.png\" alt=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_4\" data-base62-sha1=\"aLJ9JhuY9K3HKLMsjYPf9lJ55Nt\" width=\"2000\" height=\"530\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-60984-h-5-isolated-bluechip-stablecoin-spokes-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-60984-h-5-isolated-bluechip-stablecoin-spokes-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>5- Isolated Bluechip Stablecoin Spokes</h2>\n<p>The isolated bluechip stablecoin spokes represent a configuration that closely resembles the cross margin version described in the previous section, with one key distinction. Instead of placing WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC together within a single isolated spoke, this design creates a separate spoke for each bluechip asset within the Isolated Hub.

Rather than selecting a single design, we propose a layered structure that leverages multiple configurations in parallel, each serving a distinct user profile.</p>\n<p>First, we recommend maintaining a pooled Core Spoke within the Core Hub, configured with conservative parameters. This spoke serves as the foundational building block of the market and closely mirrors the user experience and risk profile of the Aave v3 Core market. It enables broad cross collateralization, supports borrowing of both stablecoins and volatile assets, and provides direct access to the deepest liquidity pools in the protocol.</p>\n<p>Second, within the Core Hub, we recommend introducing segmented Bluechip Stablecoin Spokes for each pristine collateral asset. Given the high utilization and systemic importance of assets such as WETH, separating bluechip collateral into dedicated spokes allows for improved parameterization. These spokes preserve access to Core Hub liquidity, avoid fragmentation, and enable higher borrowing power than the pooled Core Spoke.</p>\n<p>Third, we recommend deploying an Isolated Bluechip Hub with a unified Bluechip Spoke that supports cross collateralization between WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC. In this isolated environment, collateral is not rehypothecated because bluechip assets are not borrowable. This configuration provides an alternative borrowing path for users who prioritize collateral availability, elimination of liquidity risk, and avoidance of underwriting other borrowers. The isolated hub can be bootstrapped through reinvestment allocations from the Core Hub and supported by credit lines that allow it to tap into core stablecoin liquidity when required.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a5b1700197818ca807d3ae1ce14d87a2374167d2.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nDMWkj1zkQuX0XD0Q0uOFnIvrKq.png?dl=1\" title=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_rec\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/a/a5b1700197818ca807d3ae1ce14d87a2374167d2_2_1999x425.png\" alt=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_rec\" data-base62-sha1=\"nDMWkj1zkQuX0XD0Q0uOFnIvrKq\" width=\"1999\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/a/a5b1700197818ca807d3ae1ce14d87a2374167d2_2_1999x425.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/a/a5b1700197818ca807d3ae1ce14d87a2374167d2_2_2998x637.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a5b1700197818ca807d3ae1ce14d87a2374167d2.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F7F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Taken together, this structure offers borrowers three distinct risk and capital efficiency profiles.</p>\n<p>By using the pooled Core Spoke, borrowers access a fully pooled borrowing experience similar to Aave v3, with the ability to borrow both stable and volatile assets against a broad set of collateral in conjunction with bluechip collateral, but with lower borrowing power.</p>\n<p>By using the Bluechip Spokes within the Core Hub, borrowers give up the ability to borrow volatile assets and to use cross collateralization, but achieve higher borrowing power than in the pooled Core Spoke, without sacrificing access to the deep and stable liquidity of the Core Hub.</p>\n<p>By choosing the Isolated Bluechip Spoke, borrowers accept the trade off of foregoing collateral yield and direct access to Core Hub stablecoin liquidity in exchange for maximum borrowing power, no liquidity risk, no rehypothecation, and no exposure to the solvency of other borrowers.</p>\n<p>This layered approach allows Aave v4 to accommodate materially different borrower and supplier preferences without excessive liquidity fragmentation or forcing a single risk profile onto all users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-60984-conclusion-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-60984-conclusion-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Aave v4 significantly expands the design space available for over collateralized lending by enabling markets that range from fully pooled environments to completely isolated collateral structures.

This is achieved through the use of fully isolated markets, where collateral is never rehypothecated, and as such, liquidity risk is fully mitigated in the context of both withdrawals and liquidations.</p>\n<p>This analysis examines how these architectural choices can be applied to bluechip collateral.<br>\nIn this context, bluechip collateral refers specifically to WETH, WBTC and cbBTC.

After examining the designs one by one, we consolidate their features into a comparative analysis table to provide a clear assessment.

In this building block configuration, a broad set of collateral assets is combined into a single pooled environment that closely mirrors the structure of the current Aave v3 Core market. The shared collateral base enables cross collateralization across many asset types, which in turn necessitates the use of the most conservative risk parameters within the v4 design space.</p>\n<p>In this model, deposited assets are rehypothecated to generate yield based on borrower demand. Bluechip assets such as WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC are listed alongside other collateral assets, providing a familiar user experience and a risk profile that is consistent with the pooled model used today. This structure also benefits from direct access to the deepest stablecoin reserves in the protocol, which supports interest rate stability and ensures efficient borrowing conditions for users.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/6/6fc56c2793d4ad528a8abf8fdff345a68d99f40a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fWLYrD9x0erR8MUKv5UNHBVOchs.png?dl=1\" title=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/6/6fc56c2793d4ad528a8abf8fdff345a68d99f40a.png\" alt=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_1\" data-base62-sha1=\"fWLYrD9x0erR8MUKv5UNHBVOchs\" width=\"1175\" height=\"737\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-60984-h-2-bluechip-stablecoin-spoke-with-cross-margin-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-60984-h-2-bluechip-stablecoin-spoke-with-cross-margin-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2- Bluechip Stablecoin Spoke with Cross Margin</h2>\n<p>The bluechip stablecoin spoke is a dedicated configuration that allows WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC to be used as collateral to borrow stablecoins while retaining cross collateral functionality within the spoke. This structure creates a focused environment for pristine assets.</p>\n<p>The spoke continues to benefit from the deep stablecoin liquidity of the core hub, which supports rate stability and efficient borrowing conditions. Conceptually, it resembles the E Mode configuration in Aave v3, but with additional precision. As covered in our analysis <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/aave-v4-new-features-and-risk-parameter-analysis/23443\">Aave v4: New Features and Risk Parameter Analysis</a>, v4 introduces several spoke level parameters regarding how liquidation should work, including <code>targetHealthFactor</code>, <code>liquidationBonusFactor</code>, and <code>healthFactorForMaxBonus</code>. These can be tuned specifically for bluechip assets to offer a more protective liquidation environment for borrowers, reflecting their lower risk profile.</p>\n<p>Collateral within this spoke remains rehypothecated, enabling borrowers to earn a yield on their collateral. While bluechip assets can receive more favourable parameterization than in the general pooled environment, cross collateralization remains an important constraint. The volatility or utilization spike of one asset within the spoke affects the risk profile of the others during stress scenarios, which limits how aggressive the parameter settings can be. This interdependence prevents the collateral assets from reaching the more competitive risk settings achievable in segmented configurations that which we discuss in the following section.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/726dd7827340051ab167ac1f9bf824b77294ab9f.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gkhLx6ipkqO1yyWBxlxlafqOCo7.png?dl=1\" title=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_2\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/726dd7827340051ab167ac1f9bf824b77294ab9f.png\" alt=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_2\" data-base62-sha1=\"gkhLx6ipkqO1yyWBxlxlafqOCo7\" width=\"1175\" height=\"737\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-60984-h-3-bluechip-stablecoin-spokes-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-60984-h-3-bluechip-stablecoin-spokes-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3- Bluechip Stablecoin Spokes</h2>\n<p>Bluechip stablecoin spokes represent a more segmented configuration in which each pristine collateral asset is placed into its own dedicated spoke. Unlike the cross-margin design discussed earlier, this structure does not allow WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC to serve as collateral for one another. Each asset operates within an independent environment that maintains a clear separation of risk between collateral types.</p>\n<p>This configuration enables spoke-level liquidation parameters to be tailored to the specific characteristics of each individual blue-chip asset. Parameters can therefore be optimized in a more focused manner than in a cross-collateralized structure, where inter-asset volatility places limits on parameter flexibility.</p>\n<p>Collateral within these spokes continues to be rehypothecated, allowing borrowers to earn yield on their collateral based on utilization.

In this configuration, bluechip assets are not borrowable and their primary function within the hub is to serve as collateral for stablecoin borrowing.</p>\n<p>A defining feature of this design is the removal of rehypothecation. Collateral is never lent out within the isolated hub, which ensures that borrowers retain full and immediate access to their collateral at all times. As a result, borrowers are not exposed to liquidity risk during periods of elevated utilization. Furthermore, the borrowers do not underwrite the obligations of other borrowers, since the setup prevents collateral from being serviced to separate borrowing positions as debt. This eliminates solvency and default risk stemming from the behavior or risk profile of other borrowers.</p>\n<p>The absence of collateral utilization also strengthens the protocol\u2019s risk posture. Because the collateral is never deployed into lending activity, the hub maintains complete liquidity for liquidations under stress scenarios. This removes the risk of liquidations being halted due to limited available liquidity and ensures that the protocol can always execute liquidations when required. As a result, the structure supports meaningfully more competitive risk parameters, reflecting the reduced systemic risk within a fully isolated environment.</p>\n<p>This configuration is particularly well suited for borrowers who do not want their collateral to be rehypothecated and who value guaranteed availability of their deposited assets at all times. It is also an attractive environment for stablecoin suppliers who prefer to underwrite only pristine collateral and avoid exposure to a broader mix of assets.</p>\n<p>The seperate hub does introduce liquidity fragmentation, given that the isolated hub does not have direct access to the deep stablecoin liquidity of the Core Hub. This can be addressed by establishing credit lines from the Core Hub and/or through the reinvestment controller, which allows idle stable liquidity from the Core to be allocated to the Isolated Hub when needed. Both approaches come with trade offs and operational considerations that require separate and detailed analysis beyond the scope of this work.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/4/4b7aea897100c785ce3e8b3b3677d194d24563d7.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/aLJ9JhuY9K3HKLMsjYPf9lJ55Nt.png?dl=1\" title=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_4\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/4/4b7aea897100c785ce3e8b3b3677d194d24563d7.png\" alt=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_4\" data-base62-sha1=\"aLJ9JhuY9K3HKLMsjYPf9lJ55Nt\" width=\"2000\" height=\"530\" data-dominant-color=\"F8F8F8\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-60984-h-5-isolated-bluechip-stablecoin-spokes-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-60984-h-5-isolated-bluechip-stablecoin-spokes-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>5- Isolated Bluechip Stablecoin Spokes</h2>\n<p>The isolated bluechip stablecoin spokes represent a configuration that closely resembles the cross margin version described in the previous section, with one key distinction.

Rather than selecting a single design, we propose a layered structure that leverages multiple configurations in parallel, each serving a distinct user profile.</p>\n<p>First, we recommend maintaining a pooled Core Spoke within the Core Hub, configured with conservative parameters. This spoke serves as the foundational building block of the market and closely mirrors the user experience and risk profile of the Aave v3 Core market. It enables broad cross collateralization, supports borrowing of both stablecoins and volatile assets, and provides direct access to the deepest liquidity pools in the protocol.</p>\n<p>Second, within the Core Hub, we recommend introducing segmented Bluechip Stablecoin Spokes for each pristine collateral asset. Given the high utilization and systemic importance of assets such as WETH, separating bluechip collateral into dedicated spokes allows for improved parameterization. These spokes preserve access to Core Hub liquidity, avoid fragmentation, and enable higher borrowing power than the pooled Core Spoke.</p>\n<p>Third, we recommend deploying an Isolated Bluechip Hub with a unified Bluechip Spoke that supports cross collateralization between WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC. In this isolated environment, collateral is not rehypothecated because bluechip assets are not borrowable. This configuration provides an alternative borrowing path for users who prioritize collateral availability, elimination of liquidity risk, and avoidance of underwriting other borrowers. The isolated hub can be bootstrapped through reinvestment allocations from the Core Hub and supported by credit lines that allow it to tap into core stablecoin liquidity when required.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a5b1700197818ca807d3ae1ce14d87a2374167d2.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/nDMWkj1zkQuX0XD0Q0uOFnIvrKq.png?dl=1\" title=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_rec\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/a/a5b1700197818ca807d3ae1ce14d87a2374167d2_2_1999x425.png\" alt=\"Aave-v4 Configuration_rec\" data-base62-sha1=\"nDMWkj1zkQuX0XD0Q0uOFnIvrKq\" width=\"1999\" height=\"425\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/a/a5b1700197818ca807d3ae1ce14d87a2374167d2_2_1999x425.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/a/a5b1700197818ca807d3ae1ce14d87a2374167d2_2_2998x637.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a5b1700197818ca807d3ae1ce14d87a2374167d2.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"F7F7F7\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Taken together, this structure offers borrowers three distinct risk and capital efficiency profiles.</p>\n<p>By using the pooled Core Spoke, borrowers access a fully pooled borrowing experience similar to Aave v3, with the ability to borrow both stable and volatile assets against a broad set of collateral in conjunction with bluechip collateral, but with lower borrowing power.</p>\n<p>By using the Bluechip Spokes within the Core Hub, borrowers give up the ability to borrow volatile assets and to use cross collateralization, but achieve higher borrowing power than in the pooled Core Spoke, without sacrificing access to the deep and stable liquidity of the Core Hub.</p>\n<p>By choosing the Isolated Bluechip Spoke, borrowers accept the trade off of foregoing collateral yield and direct access to Core Hub stablecoin liquidity in exchange for maximum borrowing power, no liquidity risk, no rehypothecation, and no exposure to the solvency of other borrowers.</p>\n<p>This layered approach allows Aave v4 to accommodate materially different borrower and supplier preferences without excessive liquidity fragmentation or forcing a single risk profile onto all users.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-60984-conclusion-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-60984-conclusion-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Aave v4 significantly expands the design space available for over collateralized lending by enabling markets that range from fully pooled environments to completely isolated collateral structures.

By introducing multiple primitives and more flexible parameter differentiation, the protocol moves away from a rigid, singular deployment model toward a modular Hub &amp; Spoke design. This architecture allows for a variety of configurations, each presenting distinct trade-offs regarding capital efficiency, risk isolation, and systemic complexity.</p>\n<p>At LlamaRisk, we have analyzed the potential configurations that this flexible infrastructure enables. The objective of this analysis is not to predict the final implementation of Aave V4 but to <strong>map the theoretical design space</strong> available to the protocol. This ensures that governance participants and stakeholders understand the implications of how liquidity, risk, and asset integration can be organized. The following sections detail four unique architectural model choices, the strategic role of Hub-to-Spoke credit lines, and the expansion of the modularity through generalized utility spokes.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61153-the-fundamental-shift-from-monolithic-to-modular-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-the-fundamental-shift-from-monolithic-to-modular-1\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>The Fundamental Shift: From Monolithic to Modular</h2>\n<p>In previous iterations of the protocol, liquidity was pooled into a single pool or a strictly disjoint set of pools (different instances on the same chain). While this maximized liquidity depth, it also meant that the entire protocol shared a unified risk profile. If a single asset within the pool experienced a catastrophic failure, the contagion could theoretically affect all stablecoin depositors. The V4 architecture introduces the concept of a \u201cHub\u201d\u2014a liquidity container\u2014and \u201cSpokes\u201d\u2014functional modules that interact with that liquidity.</p>\n<p>This separation allows for the creation of multiple Hubs, each governed by different risk parameters, operated by different entities, or dedicated to specific asset classes. The core question for protocol architects and governance is how to arrange Hubs, Spokes, and Credit Lines to balance the competing needs of safety, growth, and efficiency.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-model-a-the-monolithic-hub-enhanced-v3-model-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-model-a-the-monolithic-hub-enhanced-v3-model-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Model A: The Monolithic Hub (Enhanced V3 Model)</h3>\n<p>The first and most familiar model is the Monolithic Hub. In this configuration, the protocol maintains a single, primary Hub where the vast majority of protocol liquidity and assets reside. All functional Spokes draw from this unified pool, either directly or by tapping into the liquidity via Credit Lines. This model is essentially an evolution of the Aave V3 paradigm but rebuilt on the V4 infrastructure.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/973e06256bfaba4fc087a9f8bb2b3f94e616f2c5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lzWYZY8UXyNBqhdrTtlN0sTbMc5.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/973e06256bfaba4fc087a9f8bb2b3f94e616f2c5.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"lzWYZY8UXyNBqhdrTtlN0sTbMc5\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" data-dominant-color=\"263F47\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Note: Specific assets/issuers are mentioned for illustrative purposes only.</em><p></p>\n<p>From a liquidity perspective, Model A offers the highest degree of efficiency. By pooling all assets into a centralized Hub, the protocol avoids fragmentation. Borrowers can access the full range of strategies, which tends to stabilize interest rates and reduce utilization spikes. For lenders, a unified pool generally offers the most consistent yield generation, as capital is not stranded in underutilized pockets of the system.</p>\n<p>However, the primary drawback of the Monolithic Hub is the concentration of risk. Because all assets coexist within the same liquidity bucket, there is no structural isolation. If a long-tail asset listed in the Monolithic Hub were to suffer a critical exploit or a total collapse in value that exceeded risk parameters, the solvency of the entire pool could be threatened. In this model, Umbrella\u2014the protocol\u2019s safety module\u2014must cover the entire system. This necessitates a conservative approach to asset listing and draw caps setup. To protect the collective liquidity and make all assets share a similar risk profile, governance must reject assets that introduce excessive volatility or centralization risk, effectively restricting the protocol\u2019s ability to service newer, more experimental markets that may have higher demand but an unjustifiable risk profile.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, additional levers arrive with Aave v4 to introduce better risk differentiation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Risk Premium</strong>, which ensures that higher-risk strategies bring incremental revenues to the LPs, boosting overall attractiveness of deposits and potentially even subsidizing the low-margin nature of bluechip asset- related borrowing strategies;</li>\n<li><strong>Credit Lines</strong>, which enable any isolated Hub to subsidize other non-connected Spokes to tap into the liquidity, specifically necessary during the bootstrapping phase of new markets and strategies. This allows a temporary, strictly defined liquidity allocation in cases where asset listing on the Main Hub would not be justifiable from the risk perspective.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-model-b-risk-profiled-hubs-segregation-by-risk-return-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-model-b-risk-profiled-hubs-segregation-by-risk-return-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Model B: Risk-Profiled Hubs (Segregation by Risk-Return)</h3>\n<p>Model B represents a reimagination of the protocol, shifting it closer to a platform of distinct credit funds. In this arrangement, the protocol is divided into multiple, distinct Hubs, each catering to a specific risk profile. For example, the system could feature a Low-Risk Hub focused on bluechip assets tranches, a High-Yield Hub accepting slightly riskier borrowing strategies, and a High-Risk Hub designed for volatile or emerging assets that are of the highest risk.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b954a33e593b8f86d643a78dd5e146e4a12b8058.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qrvFnvihxN78RtKBmsDpBIzQglO.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b954a33e593b8f86d643a78dd5e146e4a12b8058.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"qrvFnvihxN78RtKBmsDpBIzQglO\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" data-dominant-color=\"2A4349\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Note: Specific assets/issuers are mentioned for illustrative purposes only.</em><p></p>\n<p>The defining characteristic of this model is risk isolation. Each Hub operates with its own independent liquidity and, crucially, potentially its own dedicated Umbrella module. A catastrophic failure in the High-Risk Hub would have no direct financial impact on the liquidity or safety of the Low-Risk Hub. This separation allows users to self-select their risk exposure. A risk-averse depositor can supply liquidity solely to the Low-Yield Hub, confident that their funds are not exposed to the volatility of speculative assets.</p>\n<p>This model allows for targeted parameterization. Risk managers can tailor collateral efficiency parameters and interest rate curves specifically for the risk profile of each Hub. However, this segregation comes at the cost of liquidity fragmentation. Splitting liquidity into multiple distinct pools results in shallower markets for each. This can lead to increased interest rate volatility and reduced capital efficiency compared to the monolithic model. Furthermore, the viability of the Umbrella becomes a challenge for higher-risk Hubs. While a Low-Yield Hub acts similarly to the current Umbrella module for the V3\u2019s Core market, attracting stakers to backstop a High-Risk Hub would likely require extremely high premiums, potentially making the economics of such a Hub unsustainable.</p>\n<p>In order to solve the liquidity bootstrapping problem, a waterfall of credit lines could be created, each strictly limiting the maximal possible exposure to lower tranches. That way, even if liquidity of the Low-Risk Hub indirectly flows to the High-Risk Hub, the bad debt risk is exponentially smaller, covered by the Umbrella module of the intermediate risk tranche.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-model-c-asset-centric-hubs-segregation-by-asset-profile-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-model-c-asset-centric-hubs-segregation-by-asset-profile-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Model C: Asset-Centric Hubs (Segregation by Asset Profile)</h3>\n<p>Taking the concept of segregation further, Model C organizes Hubs not by risk level but by asset category or ecosystem. This model foresees highly specialized Hubs, each dedicated to a specific asset type or strategy, such as RWAs, specific stablecoin ecosystems (like an Ethena Hub), or LSTs. Each Hub functions as a standalone market with its own liquidity and potentially its own (or shared) Umbrella module. Effectively, it is a more granularly split representation of Aave\u2019s current ecosystem, together with a Prime market instance targeting ETH-correlated borrows, the Horizon instance targeting RWAs, and other white-label instances focusing on a small subset of asset types.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/108f2764a0799ac3e7f4bb8d76598efbcfaba8f1.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/2mulpknLJMmm7FUkQBlQz164KOZ.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/1/108f2764a0799ac3e7f4bb8d76598efbcfaba8f1_2_2000x1125.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"2mulpknLJMmm7FUkQBlQz164KOZ\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/1/108f2764a0799ac3e7f4bb8d76598efbcfaba8f1_2_2000x1125.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/108f2764a0799ac3e7f4bb8d76598efbcfaba8f1.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/108f2764a0799ac3e7f4bb8d76598efbcfaba8f1.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"223D44\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Note: Specific assets/issuers are mentioned for illustrative purposes only.</em><p></p>\n<p>The primary advantage of Asset-Centric Hubs is the ability to facilitate permissionless innovation and ecosystem integration. New asset types can be onboarded rapidly within their own isolated environments without requiring a risk reassessment for the entire protocol. This can foster a deeper partnership approach, allowing external protocols to have a dedicated, Aave-powered credit market for their assets. It allows the protocol to serve as infrastructure for distinct financial ecosystems without exposing one central Hub to their idiosyncratic risks.</p>\n<p>However, Model C suffers from \u201cNull Internal Diversification.\u201d Within a Hub dedicated to a single asset class or protocol, risk is highly concentrated. For instance, in a Hub dedicated entirely to a specific stablecoin ecosystem, a de-peg event would likely wipe out the entire Hub, as all collateral and borrow demand are correlated. Additionally, capitalizing an Umbrella for a single-asset Hub is exceptionally difficult. Backstopping such a Hub effectively needs an isolated risk perception of that specific asset class, which may also demand high risk premiums, hence higher borrow rates. Creation of shared Umbrella modules for multiple Hubs would be possible with the assumption that the risk profile would be balanced between the covered Hubs. Finally, a proliferation of asset-specific Hubs creates complexity for the user experience, requiring lenders to perform due diligence on dozens of individual Hubs rather than a single central liquidity Hub.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-model-d-the-hybrid-model-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-model-d-the-hybrid-model-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Model D: The Hybrid Model</h3>\n<p>The models described above are not mutually exclusive and can be constructed in conjunction. For example, Model D proposes a hybrid approach that combines the stability of a monolithic core with the flexibility of isolated, satellite spokes.

However, this model may ultimately result in higher complexity and a worse user experience due to the mixing of completely isolated and interdependent Hubs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61153-comparative-analysis-of-architectural-models-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-comparative-analysis-of-architectural-models-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Comparative Analysis of Architectural Models</h2>\n<p>To synthesize the trade-offs inherent in these designs, the following comparison highlights how each model performs across key dimensions of risk and efficiency.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Dimension</th>\n<th>Model A: Monolithic Hub</th>\n<th>Model B: Risk-Profiled Hubs</th>\n<th>Model C: Asset-Centric Hubs</th>\n<th>Model D: Hybrid Model</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Liquidity Depth</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Maximum.</strong> A nified pool ensures deep markets and stable rates.</td>\n<td><strong>Moderate.</strong> Liquidity is split across yield tiers, resulting in shallower markets.</td>\n<td><strong>Low.</strong> Highly fragmented into isolated asset pools.</td>\n<td><strong>Moderate.</strong> Maintains a deep core while allowing fragmentation at the edges.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Risk Isolation</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Moderate.</strong> Contagion can affect all LPs, albeit risk is contained via careful parameterization.</td>\n<td><strong>High.</strong> Failure in a High-Risk Hub does not impact the Low-Risk Hub.</td>\n<td><strong>High.</strong> Risk is contained entirely within the specific asset ecosystem.</td>\n<td><strong>Balanced.</strong> Core is protected from Satellites; Satellites are isolated from each other.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Capital Efficiency</strong></td>\n<td><strong>High.</strong> Assets are fully fungible, and utilization is maximized.</td>\n<td><strong>Medium.</strong> Fragmentation may lead to idle capital in specific tiers.</td>\n<td><strong>Low.</strong> Capital is trapped in specific silos and cannot cross-pollinate.</td>\n<td><strong>Medium.</strong> Core ensures efficiency, while satellites allow for targeted capital deployment.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Asset Listing Scale</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Slow.</strong> Conservative listing process creates a bottleneck.</td>\n<td><strong>Medium.</strong> Easier to onboard assets to risky tiers, but still categorized.</td>\n<td><strong>Fast.</strong> Isolated creation of hubs for any asset class.</td>\n<td><strong>Fast.</strong> Satellites allow for rapid experimentation without putting the core at risk.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>User Experience</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Simple.</strong> One pool, one set of rates.</td>\n<td><strong>Moderate.</strong> Users must choose their risk tolerance/hub.</td>\n<td><strong>Complex.</strong> Users must navigate many distinct Hubs.</td>\n<td><strong>Complex.</strong> Users must understand the distinction between Standard and Satellite Hubs.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"p-61153-the-strategic-role-of-inter-hub-credit-lines-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-the-strategic-role-of-inter-hub-credit-lines-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>The Strategic Role of Inter-Hub Credit Lines</h2>\n<p>A novel feature of the V4 architecture is the ability to establish credit lines between Hubs. This mechanism allows liquidity to flow from a parent Hub to a Spoke of a secondary Hub, introducing new possibilities for surgical risk management and capital allocation. The rationale for these credit lines generally falls into three categories: liquidity bootstrapping, spoke stabilization, and yield enhancement.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-liquidity-bootstrapping-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-liquidity-bootstrapping-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Liquidity Bootstrapping</strong></h3>\n<p>When a new, specialized Hub is launched\u2014for example, a Hub dedicated to a new asset type\u2014it faces a \u201ccold start\u201d problem, exactly like any new instance on Aave V3. Without existing liquidity, there is no utility for borrowers; without borrow demand, there is no yield for lenders. A credit line from the Main Hub allows the new Spoke to draw initial liquidity to service early borrow demand. This kickstarts the market, allowing the Spoke to function immediately while it works to attract organic deposits.</p>\n<p>However, this introduces a core challenge: if the Main Hub provides cheap, abundant liquidity, there is little incentive for the new Hub to build its own deposit base. Users and integrators may simply rely on the credit line. To mitigate this, risk premiums must be applied. The borrowing cost from the Main Hub\u2019s credit line should logically be set higher than the new Hub\u2019s native borrowing rate (e.g., Main Hub Cost + 2%). This pricing structure incentivizes borrowers to prioritize borrowing directly from the new Hub to capture better yields, eventually rendering the credit line a secondary, rather than primary, source of capital.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-spoke-stabilization-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-spoke-stabilization-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Spoke Stabilization</strong></h3>\n<p>Markets are rarely static, and smaller, specialized Hubs may face periods of significant withdrawal pressure or transient utilization volatility. In such scenarios, a credit line from a parent Hub can act as a stabilizer. If a specific Hub experiences a liquidity crunch, the credit line provides an immediate source of deeper liquidity, allowing it to retain users instead of unwinding or migrating positions. This function is analogous to a \u201clender of last resort\u201d mechanism within the protocol\u2019s own internal economy.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-yield-enhancement-and-risk-transfer-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-yield-enhancement-and-risk-transfer-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Yield Enhancement and Risk Transfer</strong></h3>\n<p>For the Main Hub, extending credit lines serves as a method of yield enhancement. By lending to a higher-risk environment, the senior Hub can capture a risk premium. Ideally, these loans are structured as \u201cSenior Debt.\u201d This means the credit line should be subject to more restrictive parameters than native borrowing within the Spoke, enforced by tightly defined draw caps of the credit line. In the event of a shortfall, the Main Hub\u2019s capital would theoretically be better protected than the Spoke\u2019s native, higher-risk deposits, especially if an Umbrella module covering the riskier Hub exists and can act as a layer of junior defense.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-conflict-of-interest-and-risk-alteration-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-conflict-of-interest-and-risk-alteration-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Conflict of Interest and Risk Alteration</strong></h3>\n<p>Despite the utility, extending credit lines introduces a conflict between the protocol\u2019s stability goals and user expectations. When a conservative Hub lends to a risky Spoke, it alters its own risk profile. Depositors in the Main Hub become indirectly exposed to the assets in the riskier satellite Hub. Even if the credit line is small relative to the total pool, this transmission of risk must be carefully managed. Transparency is critical; users must understand that their exposure is not limited to the assets in their specific Hub but extends to the counterparties (other Hubs) that their Hub lends to.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61153-expanding-the-ecosystem-generalized-spokes-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-expanding-the-ecosystem-generalized-spokes-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Expanding the Ecosystem: Generalized Spokes</h2>\n<p>Beyond the organization of liquidity into Hubs, the modular nature of the architecture allows for the generalization of Spokes. A Spoke is not merely a connection point for borrowers; it is any module that interacts with the liquidity layer. This flexibility allows for the integration of diverse functionalities that were previously difficult or impossible to implement directly on the core protocol.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-the-umbrella-spoke-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-the-umbrella-spoke-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>The Umbrella Spoke</strong></h3>\n<p>The Umbrella module itself would be implemented as a Spoke. This allows for flexibility in how coverage is applied. As noted in the analysis of different models, the Umbrella can be configured to cover a single Hub, a specific set of Hubs, or the entire network. This modularity is essential for the Model B and Model C configurations, where risk profiles vary drastically. The Umbrella Spoke defines the conditions under which safety funds are slashed and used to recapitalize a Hub, allowing for distinct insurance markets to develop around distinct risk pools.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-gho-direct-minting-spoke-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-gho-direct-minting-spoke-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>GHO Direct Minting Spoke</strong></h3>\n<p>The protocol\u2019s native stablecoin, GHO, can be integrated via a dedicated Direct Minting Spoke. In previous iterations, stablecoin minting was often tied to specific facilitators. A dedicated Spoke allows the protocol to control GHO minting capacity and parameters directly at the architectural level. This Spoke can interact with specific Hubs to allow users to mint GHO against their collateral with greater efficiency, or it can serve as a facilitator that manages the supply based on the algorithmic market state.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-vaults-spoke-segregated-collateral-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-vaults-spoke-segregated-collateral-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Vaults Spoke: Segregated Collateral</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the most significant additions for institutional adoption is the Vaults Spoke. Traditional DeFi lending usually relies on pooled collateral\u2014User A\u2019s WBTC sits in the same contract as User B\u2019s ETH. While efficient, this creates regulatory and custodial challenges for institutional actors who require asset segregation.</p>\n<p>A Vaults Spoke allows for the creation of isolated positions where collateral is not commingled with the general pool. Instead, the collateral is held in a segregated vault, yet the user can still borrow against it by accessing the protocol\u2019s liquidity. This structure satisfies the strict custody and bankruptcy-remoteness requirements of many institutional investors and CeFi services. In essence, this would mean enforcing and facilitating individual borrowing conditions for such actors in order to maximize the protocol\u2019s revenue.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-debt-trading-spoke-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-debt-trading-spoke-16\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Debt Trading Spoke</strong></h3>\n<p>The architecture supports the creation of a Debt Trading Spoke, conceptually similar to mechanisms seen in protocols like Fluid. In a typical lending market, a borrower who wishes to exit a position must repay the debt. A Debt Trading Spoke changes this dynamic by allowing users to trade their debt positions.</p>\n<p>By leveraging the deep liquidity of Aave, this spoke enables users to swap their debt obligations\u2014for example, swapping a variable-rate USDC debt for USDT debt, or transferring a debt position to another user (along with the collateral) without unwinding the underlying assets. This introduces a new revenue stream for the protocol in the form of swap fees generated directly at the protocol level. Furthermore, it increases market efficiency and competitiveness by allowing borrowers to actively manage their liabilities in response to changing interest rates as well as providing the needed tools to execute more flexible actions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-cdp-spokes-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-cdp-spokes-17\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>CDP Spokes</strong></h3>\n<p>The modular design facilitates the creation of Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) Spokes that can integrate deeply with external DEXs, specifically those supporting concentrated liquidity ranges.</p>\n<p>In this setup, LPs can use their LP positions as collateral within a CDP Spoke to borrow assets from Aave. This unlocks the value of the liquidity positions without requiring the LP to remove their funds from the DEX. The integration goes beyond simple collateralization; the Spoke can manage the specific risks associated with impermanent loss and the volatility of LP tokens. This symbiosis creates a more capital-efficient market where liquidity on the DEX is supported by the lending capacity of the credit protocol, and vice versa.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61153-conclusion-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-conclusion-18\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Aave V4 architecture offers a vast design space that goes beyond the binary choice of pooled versus isolated choices. By utilizing Hubs, Spokes, and Credit Lines, the protocol can theoretically mimic the structures of traditional finance\u2014ranging from universal banking (Monolithic) to specialized hedge funds (Risk-Profiled) and prime brokerage services (Vaults).</p>\n<p>While Model A provides the continuity of deep liquidity that DeFi relies on, the limitations regarding risk contagion are real. Conversely, while Model C offers maximum containment, it fragments liquidity to a degree that may harm utility. As governance weighs these or even more options, the focus must remain on the interplay between capital efficiency and the containment of systemic risk. These are the primary directions LlamaRisk will focus on when participating in the Aave V4 architecture definition process.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-disclaimer-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-disclaimer-19\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>This review was independently prepared by LlamaRisk, a DeFi risk firm funded partly by the Aave DAO, and is published solely within the scope assigned by the Aave DAO.

By introducing multiple primitives and more flexible parameter differentiation, the protocol moves away from a rigid, singular deployment model toward a modular Hub &amp; Spoke design. This architecture allows for a variety of configurations, each presenting distinct trade-offs regarding capital efficiency, risk isolation, and systemic complexity.</p>\n<p>At LlamaRisk, we have analyzed the potential configurations that this flexible infrastructure enables. The objective of this analysis is not to predict the final implementation of Aave V4 but to <strong>map the theoretical design space</strong> available to the protocol. This ensures that governance participants and stakeholders understand the implications of how liquidity, risk, and asset integration can be organized. The following sections detail four unique architectural model choices, the strategic role of Hub-to-Spoke credit lines, and the expansion of the modularity through generalized utility spokes.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61153-the-fundamental-shift-from-monolithic-to-modular-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-the-fundamental-shift-from-monolithic-to-modular-1\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>The Fundamental Shift: From Monolithic to Modular</h2>\n<p>In previous iterations of the protocol, liquidity was pooled into a single pool or a strictly disjoint set of pools (different instances on the same chain). While this maximized liquidity depth, it also meant that the entire protocol shared a unified risk profile. If a single asset within the pool experienced a catastrophic failure, the contagion could theoretically affect all stablecoin depositors. The V4 architecture introduces the concept of a \u201cHub\u201d\u2014a liquidity container\u2014and \u201cSpokes\u201d\u2014functional modules that interact with that liquidity.</p>\n<p>This separation allows for the creation of multiple Hubs, each governed by different risk parameters, operated by different entities, or dedicated to specific asset classes. The core question for protocol architects and governance is how to arrange Hubs, Spokes, and Credit Lines to balance the competing needs of safety, growth, and efficiency.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-model-a-the-monolithic-hub-enhanced-v3-model-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-model-a-the-monolithic-hub-enhanced-v3-model-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Model A: The Monolithic Hub (Enhanced V3 Model)</h3>\n<p>The first and most familiar model is the Monolithic Hub. In this configuration, the protocol maintains a single, primary Hub where the vast majority of protocol liquidity and assets reside. All functional Spokes draw from this unified pool, either directly or by tapping into the liquidity via Credit Lines. This model is essentially an evolution of the Aave V3 paradigm but rebuilt on the V4 infrastructure.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/973e06256bfaba4fc087a9f8bb2b3f94e616f2c5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lzWYZY8UXyNBqhdrTtlN0sTbMc5.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/973e06256bfaba4fc087a9f8bb2b3f94e616f2c5.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"lzWYZY8UXyNBqhdrTtlN0sTbMc5\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" data-dominant-color=\"263F47\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Note: Specific assets/issuers are mentioned for illustrative purposes only.</em><p></p>\n<p>From a liquidity perspective, Model A offers the highest degree of efficiency. By pooling all assets into a centralized Hub, the protocol avoids fragmentation. Borrowers can access the full range of strategies, which tends to stabilize interest rates and reduce utilization spikes. For lenders, a unified pool generally offers the most consistent yield generation, as capital is not stranded in underutilized pockets of the system.</p>\n<p>However, the primary drawback of the Monolithic Hub is the concentration of risk. Because all assets coexist within the same liquidity bucket, there is no structural isolation. If a long-tail asset listed in the Monolithic Hub were to suffer a critical exploit or a total collapse in value that exceeded risk parameters, the solvency of the entire pool could be threatened. In this model, Umbrella\u2014the protocol\u2019s safety module\u2014must cover the entire system. This necessitates a conservative approach to asset listing and draw caps setup. To protect the collective liquidity and make all assets share a similar risk profile, governance must reject assets that introduce excessive volatility or centralization risk, effectively restricting the protocol\u2019s ability to service newer, more experimental markets that may have higher demand but an unjustifiable risk profile.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, additional levers arrive with Aave v4 to introduce better risk differentiation:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Risk Premium</strong>, which ensures that higher-risk strategies bring incremental revenues to the LPs, boosting overall attractiveness of deposits and potentially even subsidizing the low-margin nature of bluechip asset- related borrowing strategies;</li>\n<li><strong>Credit Lines</strong>, which enable any isolated Hub to subsidize other non-connected Spokes to tap into the liquidity, specifically necessary during the bootstrapping phase of new markets and strategies. This allows a temporary, strictly defined liquidity allocation in cases where asset listing on the Main Hub would not be justifiable from the risk perspective.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-model-b-risk-profiled-hubs-segregation-by-risk-return-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-model-b-risk-profiled-hubs-segregation-by-risk-return-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Model B: Risk-Profiled Hubs (Segregation by Risk-Return)</h3>\n<p>Model B represents a reimagination of the protocol, shifting it closer to a platform of distinct credit funds. In this arrangement, the protocol is divided into multiple, distinct Hubs, each catering to a specific risk profile. For example, the system could feature a Low-Risk Hub focused on bluechip assets tranches, a High-Yield Hub accepting slightly riskier borrowing strategies, and a High-Risk Hub designed for volatile or emerging assets that are of the highest risk.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b954a33e593b8f86d643a78dd5e146e4a12b8058.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qrvFnvihxN78RtKBmsDpBIzQglO.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b954a33e593b8f86d643a78dd5e146e4a12b8058.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"qrvFnvihxN78RtKBmsDpBIzQglO\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" data-dominant-color=\"2A4349\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Note: Specific assets/issuers are mentioned for illustrative purposes only.</em><p></p>\n<p>The defining characteristic of this model is risk isolation. Each Hub operates with its own independent liquidity and, crucially, potentially its own dedicated Umbrella module. A catastrophic failure in the High-Risk Hub would have no direct financial impact on the liquidity or safety of the Low-Risk Hub. This separation allows users to self-select their risk exposure. A risk-averse depositor can supply liquidity solely to the Low-Yield Hub, confident that their funds are not exposed to the volatility of speculative assets.</p>\n<p>This model allows for targeted parameterization. Risk managers can tailor collateral efficiency parameters and interest rate curves specifically for the risk profile of each Hub. However, this segregation comes at the cost of liquidity fragmentation. Splitting liquidity into multiple distinct pools results in shallower markets for each. This can lead to increased interest rate volatility and reduced capital efficiency compared to the monolithic model. Furthermore, the viability of the Umbrella becomes a challenge for higher-risk Hubs. While a Low-Yield Hub acts similarly to the current Umbrella module for the V3\u2019s Core market, attracting stakers to backstop a High-Risk Hub would likely require extremely high premiums, potentially making the economics of such a Hub unsustainable.</p>\n<p>In order to solve the liquidity bootstrapping problem, a waterfall of credit lines could be created, each strictly limiting the maximal possible exposure to lower tranches. That way, even if liquidity of the Low-Risk Hub indirectly flows to the High-Risk Hub, the bad debt risk is exponentially smaller, covered by the Umbrella module of the intermediate risk tranche.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-model-c-asset-centric-hubs-segregation-by-asset-profile-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-model-c-asset-centric-hubs-segregation-by-asset-profile-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Model C: Asset-Centric Hubs (Segregation by Asset Profile)</h3>\n<p>Taking the concept of segregation further, Model C organizes Hubs not by risk level but by asset category or ecosystem. This model foresees highly specialized Hubs, each dedicated to a specific asset type or strategy, such as RWAs, specific stablecoin ecosystems (like an Ethena Hub), or LSTs. Each Hub functions as a standalone market with its own liquidity and potentially its own (or shared) Umbrella module. Effectively, it is a more granularly split representation of Aave\u2019s current ecosystem, together with a Prime market instance targeting ETH-correlated borrows, the Horizon instance targeting RWAs, and other white-label instances focusing on a small subset of asset types.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/108f2764a0799ac3e7f4bb8d76598efbcfaba8f1.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/2mulpknLJMmm7FUkQBlQz164KOZ.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/1/108f2764a0799ac3e7f4bb8d76598efbcfaba8f1_2_2000x1125.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"2mulpknLJMmm7FUkQBlQz164KOZ\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/1/108f2764a0799ac3e7f4bb8d76598efbcfaba8f1_2_2000x1125.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/108f2764a0799ac3e7f4bb8d76598efbcfaba8f1.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/108f2764a0799ac3e7f4bb8d76598efbcfaba8f1.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"223D44\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Note: Specific assets/issuers are mentioned for illustrative purposes only.</em><p></p>\n<p>The primary advantage of Asset-Centric Hubs is the ability to facilitate permissionless innovation and ecosystem integration. New asset types can be onboarded rapidly within their own isolated environments without requiring a risk reassessment for the entire protocol. This can foster a deeper partnership approach, allowing external protocols to have a dedicated, Aave-powered credit market for their assets. It allows the protocol to serve as infrastructure for distinct financial ecosystems without exposing one central Hub to their idiosyncratic risks.</p>\n<p>However, Model C suffers from \u201cNull Internal Diversification.\u201d Within a Hub dedicated to a single asset class or protocol, risk is highly concentrated. For instance, in a Hub dedicated entirely to a specific stablecoin ecosystem, a de-peg event would likely wipe out the entire Hub, as all collateral and borrow demand are correlated. Additionally, capitalizing an Umbrella for a single-asset Hub is exceptionally difficult. Backstopping such a Hub effectively needs an isolated risk perception of that specific asset class, which may also demand high risk premiums, hence higher borrow rates. Creation of shared Umbrella modules for multiple Hubs would be possible with the assumption that the risk profile would be balanced between the covered Hubs. Finally, a proliferation of asset-specific Hubs creates complexity for the user experience, requiring lenders to perform due diligence on dozens of individual Hubs rather than a single central liquidity Hub.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-model-d-the-hybrid-model-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-model-d-the-hybrid-model-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Model D: The Hybrid Model</h3>\n<p>The models described above are not mutually exclusive and can be constructed in conjunction. For example, Model D proposes a hybrid approach that combines the stability of a monolithic core with the flexibility of isolated, satellite spokes. In this configuration, the protocol maintains a primary Main (Low-Risk) Hub (similar to Models A &amp; B) focused on top-tier, blue-chip assets with the highest liquidity and security. This serves as the foundation of the protocol.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/ad186739623028287f8076d51a9383ff046fd7f9.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/oHgSVX6atzbemQint431ISrYtoB.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/a/ad186739623028287f8076d51a9383ff046fd7f9_2_2000x1125.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"oHgSVX6atzbemQint431ISrYtoB\" width=\"2000\" height=\"1125\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/a/ad186739623028287f8076d51a9383ff046fd7f9_2_2000x1125.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/ad186739623028287f8076d51a9383ff046fd7f9.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/ad186739623028287f8076d51a9383ff046fd7f9.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"233C43\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Note: Specific assets/issuers are mentioned for illustrative purposes only.</em><p></p>\n<p>Alongside this core, the architecture enables the creation of specialized satellite Hubs. These function as sandboxed environments for specific ecosystem integrations or assets with unique risk profiles. This structure preserves the benefits of a unified protocol\u2014deep liquidity for major assets\u2014while allowing for expansion into new markets without compromising the solvency of the main pool.</p>\n<p>The interaction between these layers is key. The Main Hub can act as a senior lender, cautiously extending credit lines to select satellite Spokes connected to separate Hubs. This allows the Main Hub to generate additional yield while maintaining a conservative primary risk profile, effectively separating the stable core from the higher-than-benchmark risk exposure, albeit at a cost of higher liquidity fragmentation. However, this model may ultimately result in higher complexity and a worse user experience due to the mixing of completely isolated and interdependent Hubs.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61153-comparative-analysis-of-architectural-models-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-comparative-analysis-of-architectural-models-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Comparative Analysis of Architectural Models</h2>\n<p>To synthesize the trade-offs inherent in these designs, the following comparison highlights how each model performs across key dimensions of risk and efficiency.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Dimension</th>\n<th>Model A: Monolithic Hub</th>\n<th>Model B: Risk-Profiled Hubs</th>\n<th>Model C: Asset-Centric Hubs</th>\n<th>Model D: Hybrid Model</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Liquidity Depth</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Maximum.</strong> A nified pool ensures deep markets and stable rates.</td>\n<td><strong>Moderate.</strong> Liquidity is split across yield tiers, resulting in shallower markets.</td>\n<td><strong>Low.</strong> Highly fragmented into isolated asset pools.</td>\n<td><strong>Moderate.</strong> Maintains a deep core while allowing fragmentation at the edges.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Risk Isolation</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Moderate.</strong> Contagion can affect all LPs, albeit risk is contained via careful parameterization.</td>\n<td><strong>High.</strong> Failure in a High-Risk Hub does not impact the Low-Risk Hub.</td>\n<td><strong>High.</strong> Risk is contained entirely within the specific asset ecosystem.</td>\n<td><strong>Balanced.</strong> Core is protected from Satellites; Satellites are isolated from each other.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Capital Efficiency</strong></td>\n<td><strong>High.</strong> Assets are fully fungible, and utilization is maximized.</td>\n<td><strong>Medium.</strong> Fragmentation may lead to idle capital in specific tiers.</td>\n<td><strong>Low.</strong> Capital is trapped in specific silos and cannot cross-pollinate.</td>\n<td><strong>Medium.</strong> Core ensures efficiency, while satellites allow for targeted capital deployment.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Asset Listing Scale</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Slow.</strong> Conservative listing process creates a bottleneck.</td>\n<td><strong>Medium.</strong> Easier to onboard assets to risky tiers, but still categorized.</td>\n<td><strong>Fast.</strong> Isolated creation of hubs for any asset class.</td>\n<td><strong>Fast.</strong> Satellites allow for rapid experimentation without putting the core at risk.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>User Experience</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Simple.</strong> One pool, one set of rates.</td>\n<td><strong>Moderate.</strong> Users must choose their risk tolerance/hub.</td>\n<td><strong>Complex.</strong> Users must navigate many distinct Hubs.</td>\n<td><strong>Complex.</strong> Users must understand the distinction between Standard and Satellite Hubs.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"p-61153-the-strategic-role-of-inter-hub-credit-lines-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-the-strategic-role-of-inter-hub-credit-lines-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>The Strategic Role of Inter-Hub Credit Lines</h2>\n<p>A novel feature of the V4 architecture is the ability to establish credit lines between Hubs. This mechanism allows liquidity to flow from a parent Hub to a Spoke of a secondary Hub, introducing new possibilities for surgical risk management and capital allocation. The rationale for these credit lines generally falls into three categories: liquidity bootstrapping, spoke stabilization, and yield enhancement.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-liquidity-bootstrapping-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-liquidity-bootstrapping-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Liquidity Bootstrapping</strong></h3>\n<p>When a new, specialized Hub is launched\u2014for example, a Hub dedicated to a new asset type\u2014it faces a \u201ccold start\u201d problem, exactly like any new instance on Aave V3. Without existing liquidity, there is no utility for borrowers; without borrow demand, there is no yield for lenders. A credit line from the Main Hub allows the new Spoke to draw initial liquidity to service early borrow demand. This kickstarts the market, allowing the Spoke to function immediately while it works to attract organic deposits.</p>\n<p>However, this introduces a core challenge: if the Main Hub provides cheap, abundant liquidity, there is little incentive for the new Hub to build its own deposit base. Users and integrators may simply rely on the credit line. To mitigate this, risk premiums must be applied. The borrowing cost from the Main Hub\u2019s credit line should logically be set higher than the new Hub\u2019s native borrowing rate (e.g., Main Hub Cost + 2%). This pricing structure incentivizes borrowers to prioritize borrowing directly from the new Hub to capture better yields, eventually rendering the credit line a secondary, rather than primary, source of capital.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-spoke-stabilization-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-spoke-stabilization-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Spoke Stabilization</strong></h3>\n<p>Markets are rarely static, and smaller, specialized Hubs may face periods of significant withdrawal pressure or transient utilization volatility. In such scenarios, a credit line from a parent Hub can act as a stabilizer. If a specific Hub experiences a liquidity crunch, the credit line provides an immediate source of deeper liquidity, allowing it to retain users instead of unwinding or migrating positions. This function is analogous to a \u201clender of last resort\u201d mechanism within the protocol\u2019s own internal economy.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-yield-enhancement-and-risk-transfer-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-yield-enhancement-and-risk-transfer-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Yield Enhancement and Risk Transfer</strong></h3>\n<p>For the Main Hub, extending credit lines serves as a method of yield enhancement. By lending to a higher-risk environment, the senior Hub can capture a risk premium. Ideally, these loans are structured as \u201cSenior Debt.\u201d This means the credit line should be subject to more restrictive parameters than native borrowing within the Spoke, enforced by tightly defined draw caps of the credit line. In the event of a shortfall, the Main Hub\u2019s capital would theoretically be better protected than the Spoke\u2019s native, higher-risk deposits, especially if an Umbrella module covering the riskier Hub exists and can act as a layer of junior defense.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-conflict-of-interest-and-risk-alteration-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-conflict-of-interest-and-risk-alteration-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Conflict of Interest and Risk Alteration</strong></h3>\n<p>Despite the utility, extending credit lines introduces a conflict between the protocol\u2019s stability goals and user expectations. When a conservative Hub lends to a risky Spoke, it alters its own risk profile. Depositors in the Main Hub become indirectly exposed to the assets in the riskier satellite Hub. Even if the credit line is small relative to the total pool, this transmission of risk must be carefully managed. Transparency is critical; users must understand that their exposure is not limited to the assets in their specific Hub but extends to the counterparties (other Hubs) that their Hub lends to.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61153-expanding-the-ecosystem-generalized-spokes-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-expanding-the-ecosystem-generalized-spokes-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Expanding the Ecosystem: Generalized Spokes</h2>\n<p>Beyond the organization of liquidity into Hubs, the modular nature of the architecture allows for the generalization of Spokes. A Spoke is not merely a connection point for borrowers; it is any module that interacts with the liquidity layer. This flexibility allows for the integration of diverse functionalities that were previously difficult or impossible to implement directly on the core protocol.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-the-umbrella-spoke-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-the-umbrella-spoke-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>The Umbrella Spoke</strong></h3>\n<p>The Umbrella module itself would be implemented as a Spoke. This allows for flexibility in how coverage is applied. As noted in the analysis of different models, the Umbrella can be configured to cover a single Hub, a specific set of Hubs, or the entire network. This modularity is essential for the Model B and Model C configurations, where risk profiles vary drastically. The Umbrella Spoke defines the conditions under which safety funds are slashed and used to recapitalize a Hub, allowing for distinct insurance markets to develop around distinct risk pools.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-gho-direct-minting-spoke-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-gho-direct-minting-spoke-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>GHO Direct Minting Spoke</strong></h3>\n<p>The protocol\u2019s native stablecoin, GHO, can be integrated via a dedicated Direct Minting Spoke. In previous iterations, stablecoin minting was often tied to specific facilitators. A dedicated Spoke allows the protocol to control GHO minting capacity and parameters directly at the architectural level. This Spoke can interact with specific Hubs to allow users to mint GHO against their collateral with greater efficiency, or it can serve as a facilitator that manages the supply based on the algorithmic market state.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-vaults-spoke-segregated-collateral-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-vaults-spoke-segregated-collateral-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Vaults Spoke: Segregated Collateral</strong></h3>\n<p>One of the most significant additions for institutional adoption is the Vaults Spoke. Traditional DeFi lending usually relies on pooled collateral\u2014User A\u2019s WBTC sits in the same contract as User B\u2019s ETH. While efficient, this creates regulatory and custodial challenges for institutional actors who require asset segregation.</p>\n<p>A Vaults Spoke allows for the creation of isolated positions where collateral is not commingled with the general pool. Instead, the collateral is held in a segregated vault, yet the user can still borrow against it by accessing the protocol\u2019s liquidity. This structure satisfies the strict custody and bankruptcy-remoteness requirements of many institutional investors and CeFi services. In essence, this would mean enforcing and facilitating individual borrowing conditions for such actors in order to maximize the protocol\u2019s revenue.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-debt-trading-spoke-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-debt-trading-spoke-16\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Debt Trading Spoke</strong></h3>\n<p>The architecture supports the creation of a Debt Trading Spoke, conceptually similar to mechanisms seen in protocols like Fluid. In a typical lending market, a borrower who wishes to exit a position must repay the debt. A Debt Trading Spoke changes this dynamic by allowing users to trade their debt positions.</p>\n<p>By leveraging the deep liquidity of Aave, this spoke enables users to swap their debt obligations\u2014for example, swapping a variable-rate USDC debt for USDT debt, or transferring a debt position to another user (along with the collateral) without unwinding the underlying assets. This introduces a new revenue stream for the protocol in the form of swap fees generated directly at the protocol level. Furthermore, it increases market efficiency and competitiveness by allowing borrowers to actively manage their liabilities in response to changing interest rates as well as providing the needed tools to execute more flexible actions.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-cdp-spokes-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-cdp-spokes-17\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>CDP Spokes</strong></h3>\n<p>The modular design facilitates the creation of Collateralized Debt Position (CDP) Spokes that can integrate deeply with external DEXs, specifically those supporting concentrated liquidity ranges.</p>\n<p>In this setup, LPs can use their LP positions as collateral within a CDP Spoke to borrow assets from Aave. This unlocks the value of the liquidity positions without requiring the LP to remove their funds from the DEX. The integration goes beyond simple collateralization; the Spoke can manage the specific risks associated with impermanent loss and the volatility of LP tokens. This symbiosis creates a more capital-efficient market where liquidity on the DEX is supported by the lending capacity of the credit protocol, and vice versa.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61153-conclusion-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-conclusion-18\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The Aave V4 architecture offers a vast design space that goes beyond the binary choice of pooled versus isolated choices. By utilizing Hubs, Spokes, and Credit Lines, the protocol can theoretically mimic the structures of traditional finance\u2014ranging from universal banking (Monolithic) to specialized hedge funds (Risk-Profiled) and prime brokerage services (Vaults).</p>\n<p>While Model A provides the continuity of deep liquidity that DeFi relies on, the limitations regarding risk contagion are real. Conversely, while Model C offers maximum containment, it fragments liquidity to a degree that may harm utility. As governance weighs these or even more options, the focus must remain on the interplay between capital efficiency and the containment of systemic risk. These are the primary directions LlamaRisk will focus on when participating in the Aave V4 architecture definition process.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61153-disclaimer-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61153-disclaimer-19\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>This review was independently prepared by LlamaRisk, a DeFi risk firm funded partly by the Aave DAO, and is published solely within the scope assigned by the Aave DAO.

By learning from the successes and challenges of other DeFi protocols, particularly Uniswap v4 and Chainlink, I tried to identify practical insights and concrete steps to support Aave v4 developers from experimentation to long-term maintenance.</p>\n<p>Over the last few months, I have studied how major DeFi protocols built developer ecosystems, focusing on Uniswap v4 and Chainlink, to understand what worked, what failed, and where friction appeared. The reason is simple: Aave v4 is becoming a developer platform, not just a protocol, and without learning from prior experiments, it risks repeating the same early mistakes on a larger scale.</p>\n<p>From what I gathered, lessons from other protocols show clear patterns: Uniswap v4 successfully onboarded builders through early tooling and education programs, but friction arose from fragmentation and weak long-term maintenance incentives, while Chainlink grew steadily by providing continuous support, clear integration paths, and usage-based incentives that encouraged sustainable adoption.</p>\n<p><strong>Aave v4 needs a clear and intentional developer lifecycle from day one.</strong> Not a heavy process and not rigid control, but a practical path that helps teams move from idea to production to maintenance without burning out or fragmenting the protocol. Without that clarity, developers get lost early and the ecosystem becomes noisy and fragile.</p>\n<p><strong>Lessons from Uniswap v4</strong></p>\n<p>Uniswap v4 invested early in tooling, education, and security support. Programs like Atrium Hook Incubator and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/sid_areta\">@sid_areta</a> Areta Security Fund onboarded hundreds of developers, shipped over <strong>1000 hooks,</strong> and supported several mainnet launches. Total developer program spend was <strong>$14.8M</strong> committed, $9.9M disbursed in FY2024. Early outputs focused on shipped prototypes and developer onboarding rather than immediate TVL concentration. The key lesson is that targeted funding and structured cohorts reduce friction and produce measurable outputs, but long-term retention requires ongoing incentives. (Some numbers might be higher).</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Program / Initiative</th>\n<th>Spend</th>\n<th>Duration</th>\n<th>Output / Impact</th>\n<th>Key Lesson</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Atrium / Hook Incubator</td>\n<td>~$1.2M</td>\n<td>18 months (2024\u20132025)</td>\n<td>~1,200 applicants, ~800 developers onboarded, ~150 hooks shipped</td>\n<td>Structured cohorts + funding produce measurable prototypes and reduce friction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Areta / Security Fund</td>\n<td>~$1.2M</td>\n<td>18 months (2024\u20132025)</td>\n<td>Audit subsidies for 9\u201320 teams, supported 5 mainnet launches</td>\n<td>Subsidized audits reduce launch risk and ensure early security</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Overall Developer Program</td>\n<td>$14.8M committed, $9.9M disbursed (FY2024)</td>\n<td>FY2024</td>\n<td>Hundreds of developers engaged, 5,000+ v4 hooks initialized</td>\n<td>Large-scale funding drives rapid ecosystem growth but retention needs follow-on incentives</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>Lessons from Chainlink</strong></p>\n<p>Chainlink grew more steadily through continuous support rather than discrete cohorts. Its SCALE program engaged roughly <strong>4,000 builders across 16 chains,</strong> generating over 300M verified messages. Hackathons and grants reached ~1,800 participants and produced 150\u2013200 projects per event. The ecosystem now includes ~2,600 projects and ~2,400 integrations, securing <strong>$100B+ in value.</strong> The key lesson is that decentralized, ongoing support scales real usage and adoption, though it produces fewer discrete cohort outputs. (Some numbers might be higher).</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Program / Initiative</th>\n<th>Spend</th>\n<th>Duration</th>\n<th>Output / Impact</th>\n<th>Key Lesson</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Scale Program</td>\n<td>Distributed / event-driven</td>\n<td>Multi-year (~3+ years)</td>\n<td>16 chains supported, ~4,000 builders engaged, 300M+ verified messages</td>\n<td>Continuous support scales adoption and real usage rather than discrete cohort outputs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hackathons &amp; Grants</td>\n<td>Small prizes ($10k\u2013$20k+ per event)</td>\n<td>Rolling</td>\n<td>1,800+ participants, 150\u2013200 projects per event, 2,600 projects listed</td>\n<td>Decentralized incentives drive experimentation but produce fewer neat cohort metrics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ecosystem Usage</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Multi-year</td>\n<td>~2,400+ integrations, $100B+ value secured</td>\n<td>Impact measured via real usage and operational adoption rather than discrete cohort output</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>Aave v4 Developer Lifecycle</strong></p>\n<p>Taken together, these lessons point to a clear insight: developer ecosystems fail less from lack of funding than from lack of a visible journey. Aave v4 can avoid common pitfalls by implementing a structured developer lifecycle from day one.

If Aave v4 only rewards creation, developers will optimize for launches and move on. By also rewarding care, reliability, and long-term alignment, teams are incentivized to stay. With service providers supporting both operational health and protocol guidance, the focus after launch naturally shifts to continuous monitoring and long-term maintenance.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61039-conclusion-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61039-conclusion-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Conclusion:</strong></h1>\n<p>Aave v4 can avoid the common pitfalls seen in other ecosystems by providing a clear developer lifecycle. This lifecycle makes experimentation easy, ensures outputs are measurable, and rewards long-term maintenance. A structured path is essential for Aave v4 to succeed as a developer platform and become a foundational coordination layer for DeFi.</p>\n<p>That said, Aave v4 is not on mainnet yet, <strong>there are still many important questions that need clear answers</strong> before final Aave v4 mainnet governance decision is made. These are meant to drive discussion, not suggest fixed solutions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How much credit lines should be allocated to spoke developer initiatives?</strong> Should there be a fixed fund (e.g., $100K, $1M) per spoke, or a dynamic mechanism based on risk and usage?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Should spokes be allowed to launch their own tokens?</strong> Or should economic incentives be limited to protocol fees and yield only?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If service providers launch spokes, should they be permitted to issue a token for those spokes?</strong> Or does that risk conflicting incentives?</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Should all spokes be treated equally in credit line allocation and governance consideration?</strong> Avoiding special private arrangements that could fragment capital or create uneven opportunities?

By learning from the successes and challenges of other DeFi protocols, particularly Uniswap v4 and Chainlink, I tried to identify practical insights and concrete steps to support Aave v4 developers from experimentation to long-term maintenance.</p>\n<p>Over the last few months, I have studied how major DeFi protocols built developer ecosystems, focusing on Uniswap v4 and Chainlink, to understand what worked, what failed, and where friction appeared. The reason is simple: Aave v4 is becoming a developer platform, not just a protocol, and without learning from prior experiments, it risks repeating the same early mistakes on a larger scale.</p>\n<p>From what I gathered, lessons from other protocols show clear patterns: Uniswap v4 successfully onboarded builders through early tooling and education programs, but friction arose from fragmentation and weak long-term maintenance incentives, while Chainlink grew steadily by providing continuous support, clear integration paths, and usage-based incentives that encouraged sustainable adoption.</p>\n<p><strong>Aave v4 needs a clear and intentional developer lifecycle from day one.</strong> Not a heavy process and not rigid control, but a practical path that helps teams move from idea to production to maintenance without burning out or fragmenting the protocol. Without that clarity, developers get lost early and the ecosystem becomes noisy and fragile.</p>\n<p><strong>Lessons from Uniswap v4</strong></p>\n<p>Uniswap v4 invested early in tooling, education, and security support. Programs like Atrium Hook Incubator and <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/sid_areta\">@sid_areta</a> Areta Security Fund onboarded hundreds of developers, shipped over <strong>1000 hooks,</strong> and supported several mainnet launches. Total developer program spend was <strong>$14.8M</strong> committed, $9.9M disbursed in FY2024. Early outputs focused on shipped prototypes and developer onboarding rather than immediate TVL concentration. The key lesson is that targeted funding and structured cohorts reduce friction and produce measurable outputs, but long-term retention requires ongoing incentives. (Some numbers might be higher).</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Program / Initiative</th>\n<th>Spend</th>\n<th>Duration</th>\n<th>Output / Impact</th>\n<th>Key Lesson</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Atrium / Hook Incubator</td>\n<td>~$1.2M</td>\n<td>18 months (2024\u20132025)</td>\n<td>~1,200 applicants, ~800 developers onboarded, ~150 hooks shipped</td>\n<td>Structured cohorts + funding produce measurable prototypes and reduce friction</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Areta / Security Fund</td>\n<td>~$1.2M</td>\n<td>18 months (2024\u20132025)</td>\n<td>Audit subsidies for 9\u201320 teams, supported 5 mainnet launches</td>\n<td>Subsidized audits reduce launch risk and ensure early security</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Overall Developer Program</td>\n<td>$14.8M committed, $9.9M disbursed (FY2024)</td>\n<td>FY2024</td>\n<td>Hundreds of developers engaged, 5,000+ v4 hooks initialized</td>\n<td>Large-scale funding drives rapid ecosystem growth but retention needs follow-on incentives</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>Lessons from Chainlink</strong></p>\n<p>Chainlink grew more steadily through continuous support rather than discrete cohorts. Its SCALE program engaged roughly <strong>4,000 builders across 16 chains,</strong> generating over 300M verified messages. Hackathons and grants reached ~1,800 participants and produced 150\u2013200 projects per event. The ecosystem now includes ~2,600 projects and ~2,400 integrations, securing <strong>$100B+ in value.</strong> The key lesson is that decentralized, ongoing support scales real usage and adoption, though it produces fewer discrete cohort outputs. (Some numbers might be higher).</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Program / Initiative</th>\n<th>Spend</th>\n<th>Duration</th>\n<th>Output / Impact</th>\n<th>Key Lesson</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Scale Program</td>\n<td>Distributed / event-driven</td>\n<td>Multi-year (~3+ years)</td>\n<td>16 chains supported, ~4,000 builders engaged, 300M+ verified messages</td>\n<td>Continuous support scales adoption and real usage rather than discrete cohort outputs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hackathons &amp; Grants</td>\n<td>Small prizes ($10k\u2013$20k+ per event)</td>\n<td>Rolling</td>\n<td>1,800+ participants, 150\u2013200 projects per event, 2,600 projects listed</td>\n<td>Decentralized incentives drive experimentation but produce fewer neat cohort metrics</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ecosystem Usage</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Multi-year</td>\n<td>~2,400+ integrations, $100B+ value secured</td>\n<td>Impact measured via real usage and operational adoption rather than discrete cohort output</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>Aave v4 Developer Lifecycle</strong></p>\n<p>Taken together, these lessons point to a clear insight: developer ecosystems fail less from lack of funding than from lack of a visible journey. Aave v4 can avoid common pitfalls by implementing a structured developer lifecycle from day one. This lifecycle guides teams from early experimentation to production, audit support, governance participation, and long-term maintenance. Clear stages, targeted incentives, and visible service provider support make experimentation easy, success measurable, and long-term alignment sustainable.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Timeline</th>\n<th>Stage</th>\n<th>Target</th>\n<th>Purpose</th>\n<th>Program</th>\n<th>SPs.</th>\n<th>Roles of SPs.</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1\u20132 months</td>\n<td>Testnet</td>\n<td>Early builders experimenting with spokes</td>\n<td>Learn Aave v4 design and build prototypes safely</td>\n<td>Testnet Aave Grants &amp; Open Calls</td>\n<td>ALL SPs</td>\n<td>BGD Labs guides design and implementation; ACI connects teams to resources and early feedback; Aave Labs provides protocol guidance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1\u20132 months</td>\n<td>Early Usage</td>\n<td>Prototypes with small users or limited capital</td>\n<td>Validate product-market fit and early governance readiness</td>\n<td><strong>Aave Hackathons &amp; Builder Programs</strong></td>\n<td>ACI, BGD Labs, Aave Labs</td>\n<td>ACI mentors on community engagement; BGD Labs advises on technical integration; Aave Labs provides ongoing support</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FIRST Checkpoint</strong></td>\n<td>Governance \u2013 Temp Check</td>\n<td>Community &amp; stakeholders</td>\n<td>30-day discussion feedbacks</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>ALL Members.</td>\n<td>Service providers moderate discussion, provide technical guidance, summarize feedback for Snapshot vote</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1\u20132 months</td>\n<td>Pre-Mainnet Security</td>\n<td>Aave</td>\n<td>Hackathon winners and pilots ready for live deployment</td>\n<td>Prepare production-ready code <strong>Aave Security Fund &amp; Audit Support</strong></td>\n<td>Certora, Chaos Labs, LlamaRisk, Aave Labs\"</td>\n<td>Certora conducts formal audits; Chaos &amp; LlamaRisk support risk modeling; Aave Labs ensures protocol integration</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>SECOND Checkpoint</strong></td>\n<td>Governance \u2013 Snapshot</td>\n<td>Community &amp; stakeholders</td>\n<td>Vote to approve moving prototypes to mainnet after audit</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>ALL Members.</td>\n<td>Service providers advise on risk, audit findings, and readiness to inform the community vote</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1\u20132 months</td>\n<td>Mainnet Launch</td>\n<td>Live spokes with initial users and liquidity</td>\n<td>Ensure safe operation and monitor real-world behavior</td>\n<td>Mainnet Launch Support</td>\n<td>Chaos Labs, LlamaRisk, Aave Labs</td>\n<td>Chaos &amp; LlamaRisk track risk parameters and recommend adjustments; Aave Labs monitors protocol alignment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>THIRD Checkpoint</strong></td>\n<td>ARFC / Initial Credit</td>\n<td>Mature spokes seeking scale via credit lines or integration</td>\n<td>Evaluate long-term risk, and alignment; propose initial GHO line of credit</td>\n<td>ARFC Proposal</td>\n<td>ALL Members.</td>\n<td>Chaos &amp; LlamaRisk assess risk; TokenLogic analyzes viability; Certora reviews integrity; ACI supports narrative; Aave Labs ensures protocol-level credit alignment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>FINAL Checkpoint</strong></td>\n<td>\u2013 ARFC Snapshot</td>\n<td>Community &amp; stakeholders</td>\n<td>Vote on approval of initial GHO credit line; community uses live mainnet experience</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>ALL Members.</td>\n<td>Service providers provide risk assessment, performance metrics, and guidance to inform the community vote</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ongoing</td>\n<td>Long-Term Alignment / Additional Credit</td>\n<td>Established spokes driving consistent usage</td>\n<td>Maintain reliability, reward impact, and sustain growth; propose additional GHO lines if platform performs</td>\n<td><strong>Aave Retro Grants &amp; Ongoing Support</strong></td>\n<td>Chaos Labs, LlamaRisk, TokenLogic, BGD Labs, ACI, Aave Labs</td>\n<td>Chaos &amp; LlamaRisk support ongoing risk ops; TokenLogic maintains financial stability; BGD Labs updates code; ACI drives growth; Aave Labs oversees protocol alignment</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ongoing</td>\n<td>Governance \u2013 Future AIP Votes</td>\n<td>Community &amp; stakeholders</td>\n<td>Authorize additional credit or protocol adjustments based on performance</td>\n<td>N/A</td>\n<td>Chaos Labs, LlamaRisk, TokenLogic, BGD Labs, ACI, Aave Labs</td>\n<td>Service providers provide operational, financial, and technical guidance to support informed community decision-making</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>If the process is followed correctly, with committed teams building spokes and all governance checkpoints passing, a project can move from idea to initial credit lines in six months or less.</strong></p>\n<p>Beyond that, a successful spoke requires ongoing safety upgrades and attention to financial and economic health.

      "description": "\n            <h1><a name=\"p-61125-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61125-summary-1\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Summary</h1>\n<p>This document develops a framework for dynamically calibrating key parameters of the Aave Umbrella system through autonomous Risk Oracles. Umbrella introduces a reserve-level decentralized coverage layer in which participants supply slashable backstop capital and receive incremental compensation financed by protocol-defined emissions. The effectiveness of this mechanism depends on maintaining coherent incentives and coverage targets as reserve conditions evolve, rather than relying on static nominal settings or infrequent parameter updates.</p>\n<p>Rather than treating Umbrella configuration as a fixed schedule, we outline a state-contingent parameterization that expresses both coverage and incentive intensity in relative terms. Coverage is represented as a thickness ratio (coverage capital per unit exposure), and incentive spend is represented as a fraction of reserve revenue, yielding a scale-free mapping from observable reserve state to an implied incremental yield. This formulation preserves a transparent accounting interpretation, linking the effective cost of coverage to reserve revenues, while allowing parameters to move consistently with demand regimes.</p>\n<p>Risk Oracles act as autonomous agents that monitor reserve dynamics off-chain and reparameterize the system accordingly, enabling tighter alignment between the coverage market\u2019s pricing and the underlying reserve environment with minimal operational overhead. Subsequent work extends the framework to the endogenous construction of coverage targets and broader deployment across markets.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61125-problem-statement-absence-of-real-time-parameter-optimization-in-umbrella-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61125-problem-statement-absence-of-real-time-parameter-optimization-in-umbrella-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Problem statement: absence of real-time parameter optimization in Umbrella</h2>\n<p>Umbrella\u2019s core incentive and coverage parameters, most notably Target Liquidity and MaxEmissionPerYear, are specified in static, nominal token units (i.e., absolute quantities of the underlying asset or rewards token), rather than as functions of endogenous market state variables such as demand, utilization, or prevailing supply/borrow rates. This design choice implicitly assumes that the demand regime and the induced equilibrium rates are relatively stationary over the calibration horizon. In practice, however, Aave markets are highly regime-dependent: demand for debt can shift rapidly, and the endogenous interest-rate environment adjusts accordingly. This creates a structural mismatch between fixed nominal incentive schedules and state-dependent market pricing of risk and liquidity, leading to systematic inefficiencies (\u201cleakage\u201d) that can invert Umbrella\u2019s intended risk-alignment properties.</p>\n<p>When borrowing demand declines, the underlying market supply rate on the reserve decreases. Because MaxEmissionPerYear is fixed in nominal terms, the incremental yield subsidized by Umbrella constitutes an increasing fraction of the total risk-free (or baseline) return available to suppliers. Put differently, the program can become most generous precisely when system leverage and outstanding debt are lowest, a regime in which marginal coverage is least economically valuable. This results in over-incentivization and inefficient reward spend during periods of lower risk exposure.</p>\n<p>Conversely, when borrowing demand rises, baseline supply rates rise endogenously, and the fixed nominal emission budget translates into a smaller incremental yield spread relative to market rates. In this regime, the effective attractiveness of staking into Umbrella may decline, weakening participation and reducing coverage at exactly the time when (i) outstanding debt is higher, (ii) tail risk scales up, and (iii) coverage is most valuable from a solvency perspective.</p>\n<p>A similar issue arises for Target Liquidity. In principle, optimal target coverage should scale with the system\u2019s risk exposure, which is naturally proxied by outstanding nominal debt and its distribution across collateral types and liquidity conditions. If Target Liquidity is derived from a Value-at-Risk (VaR) framework, it should evolve continuously as the underlying exposure set evolves. A static nominal target (or infrequently updated parameterization) can therefore be miscalibrated: either demanding excessive capital in low-exposure regimes or failing to require sufficient coverage when exposures expand.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, from an operational perspective, altering the underlying value of either TargetLiquidity or MaxEmissionPerYear results in the other being implicitly transformed in accordance with the underlying objective, as altering one but not the other arguably misaligns the targeted incentive structure employed (e.g., increasing TargetLiquidity while maintaining MaxEmissionPerYear results in a lower incremental APR at the target).</p>\n<p>Taken together, these dynamics imply that static nominal parameterization induces a procyclical distortion: incentives can be strongest when marginal risk is weakest, and weakest when marginal risk is strongest. The central gap is the lack of a real-time, state-contingent optimization mechanism that adapts Umbrella parameters as functions of observable market conditions (utilization, debt demand, rates, and risk metrics), thereby minimizing reward leakage while maintaining (or improving) required coverage across regimes.<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/6/6f9c02994f8dd23f14ab90103d08af7764bf5bb4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fVlfsNOW6L8D4HQRzpr9DQslcMc.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/6/6f9c02994f8dd23f14ab90103d08af7764bf5bb4.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"fVlfsNOW6L8D4HQRzpr9DQslcMc\" width=\"1166\" height=\"1430\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/ff7adc42035e20cc1c72f6a24ad27a615a410ff3.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/As4YTgAwPeg8rkf6dJm18GCE6z1.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/ff7adc42035e20cc1c72f6a24ad27a615a410ff3.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"As4YTgAwPeg8rkf6dJm18GCE6z1\" width=\"1134\" height=\"1404\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a9b6fbbd2b908596c138efeac6ad8ca72cd17b9b.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/odmJpRWS71FykpxVGMtiNeRQkcP.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a9b6fbbd2b908596c138efeac6ad8ca72cd17b9b.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"odmJpRWS71FykpxVGMtiNeRQkcP\" width=\"1144\" height=\"1350\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/576e13a54b446bbda8297e7280911f055e31a4f5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ctrns1FQPqwH7cX6X86QGMhE96d.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/576e13a54b446bbda8297e7280911f055e31a4f5.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ctrns1FQPqwH7cX6X86QGMhE96d\" width=\"1126\" height=\"1164\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/e03e942a7c206c3b2660c2fa6a12819dd59d6557.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vZL1INHgtNoSCfVExkZPgJtTH2T.png?dl=1\" title=\"image -

Umbrella introduces a reserve-level decentralized coverage layer in which participants supply slashable backstop capital and receive incremental compensation financed by protocol-defined emissions. The effectiveness of this mechanism depends on maintaining coherent incentives and coverage targets as reserve conditions evolve, rather than relying on static nominal settings or infrequent parameter updates.</p>\n<p>Rather than treating Umbrella configuration as a fixed schedule, we outline a state-contingent parameterization that expresses both coverage and incentive intensity in relative terms. Coverage is represented as a thickness ratio (coverage capital per unit exposure), and incentive spend is represented as a fraction of reserve revenue, yielding a scale-free mapping from observable reserve state to an implied incremental yield. This formulation preserves a transparent accounting interpretation, linking the effective cost of coverage to reserve revenues, while allowing parameters to move consistently with demand regimes.</p>\n<p>Risk Oracles act as autonomous agents that monitor reserve dynamics off-chain and reparameterize the system accordingly, enabling tighter alignment between the coverage market\u2019s pricing and the underlying reserve environment with minimal operational overhead. Subsequent work extends the framework to the endogenous construction of coverage targets and broader deployment across markets.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61125-problem-statement-absence-of-real-time-parameter-optimization-in-umbrella-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61125-problem-statement-absence-of-real-time-parameter-optimization-in-umbrella-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Problem statement: absence of real-time parameter optimization in Umbrella</h2>\n<p>Umbrella\u2019s core incentive and coverage parameters, most notably Target Liquidity and MaxEmissionPerYear, are specified in static, nominal token units (i.e., absolute quantities of the underlying asset or rewards token), rather than as functions of endogenous market state variables such as demand, utilization, or prevailing supply/borrow rates. This design choice implicitly assumes that the demand regime and the induced equilibrium rates are relatively stationary over the calibration horizon. In practice, however, Aave markets are highly regime-dependent: demand for debt can shift rapidly, and the endogenous interest-rate environment adjusts accordingly. This creates a structural mismatch between fixed nominal incentive schedules and state-dependent market pricing of risk and liquidity, leading to systematic inefficiencies (\u201cleakage\u201d) that can invert Umbrella\u2019s intended risk-alignment properties.</p>\n<p>When borrowing demand declines, the underlying market supply rate on the reserve decreases. Because MaxEmissionPerYear is fixed in nominal terms, the incremental yield subsidized by Umbrella constitutes an increasing fraction of the total risk-free (or baseline) return available to suppliers. Put differently, the program can become most generous precisely when system leverage and outstanding debt are lowest, a regime in which marginal coverage is least economically valuable. This results in over-incentivization and inefficient reward spend during periods of lower risk exposure.</p>\n<p>Conversely, when borrowing demand rises, baseline supply rates rise endogenously, and the fixed nominal emission budget translates into a smaller incremental yield spread relative to market rates. In this regime, the effective attractiveness of staking into Umbrella may decline, weakening participation and reducing coverage at exactly the time when (i) outstanding debt is higher, (ii) tail risk scales up, and (iii) coverage is most valuable from a solvency perspective.</p>\n<p>A similar issue arises for Target Liquidity. In principle, optimal target coverage should scale with the system\u2019s risk exposure, which is naturally proxied by outstanding nominal debt and its distribution across collateral types and liquidity conditions. If Target Liquidity is derived from a Value-at-Risk (VaR) framework, it should evolve continuously as the underlying exposure set evolves. A static nominal target (or infrequently updated parameterization) can therefore be miscalibrated: either demanding excessive capital in low-exposure regimes or failing to require sufficient coverage when exposures expand.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, from an operational perspective, altering the underlying value of either TargetLiquidity or MaxEmissionPerYear results in the other being implicitly transformed in accordance with the underlying objective, as altering one but not the other arguably misaligns the targeted incentive structure employed (e.g., increasing TargetLiquidity while maintaining MaxEmissionPerYear results in a lower incremental APR at the target).</p>\n<p>Taken together, these dynamics imply that static nominal parameterization induces a procyclical distortion: incentives can be strongest when marginal risk is weakest, and weakest when marginal risk is strongest. The central gap is the lack of a real-time, state-contingent optimization mechanism that adapts Umbrella parameters as functions of observable market conditions (utilization, debt demand, rates, and risk metrics), thereby minimizing reward leakage while maintaining (or improving) required coverage across regimes.<br>\n</p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/6/6f9c02994f8dd23f14ab90103d08af7764bf5bb4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/fVlfsNOW6L8D4HQRzpr9DQslcMc.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/6/6f9c02994f8dd23f14ab90103d08af7764bf5bb4.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"fVlfsNOW6L8D4HQRzpr9DQslcMc\" width=\"1166\" height=\"1430\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/ff7adc42035e20cc1c72f6a24ad27a615a410ff3.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/As4YTgAwPeg8rkf6dJm18GCE6z1.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/ff7adc42035e20cc1c72f6a24ad27a615a410ff3.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"As4YTgAwPeg8rkf6dJm18GCE6z1\" width=\"1134\" height=\"1404\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a9b6fbbd2b908596c138efeac6ad8ca72cd17b9b.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/odmJpRWS71FykpxVGMtiNeRQkcP.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a9b6fbbd2b908596c138efeac6ad8ca72cd17b9b.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"odmJpRWS71FykpxVGMtiNeRQkcP\" width=\"1144\" height=\"1350\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/576e13a54b446bbda8297e7280911f055e31a4f5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ctrns1FQPqwH7cX6X86QGMhE96d.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/576e13a54b446bbda8297e7280911f055e31a4f5.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ctrns1FQPqwH7cX6X86QGMhE96d\" width=\"1126\" height=\"1164\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/e03e942a7c206c3b2660c2fa6a12819dd59d6557.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vZL1INHgtNoSCfVExkZPgJtTH2T.png?dl=1\" title=\"image -

By expressing both coverage and spend in relative terms, the controller adapts automatically to changes in utilization and the reserve\u2019s revenue environment, reducing leakage and avoiding procyclical incentive behavior. The result is a simple, automatable rule that produces reserve-specific spend recommendations under current market conditions and maps them directly into Umbrella parameter updates.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61125-disclosure-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61125-disclosure-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclosure</h2>\n<p>Chaos Labs has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this research paper and ensuing risk oracle.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61125-copyright-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61125-copyright-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Copyright</h2>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived via <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CC0</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>3 posts - 2 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-umbrella-risk-oracles/23897\">Read full topic</a></p>\n          ",
