      "description": "\n            <h1><a name=\"p-61208-overview-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-overview-1\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Overview</h1>\n<p>The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate and propose the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes for WETH, cbBTC, and WBTC on Aave v3. These configurations are designed to allow users to opt into a borrowing environment where supplied collateral is not rehypothecated, thereby eliminating liquidity and liquidation execution risk arising from rehypothecation, removing borrower exposure to counterparty default risk, and enabling more competitive risk parameterization.</p>\n<p>Historically, Aave has mostly relied on a pooled collateral model in which supplied assets are rehypothecated to support capital efficient lending markets. This design has formed the foundation of Aave\u2019s growth and remains the dominant structure across onchain lending today. In parallel, relatively small but steadily growing segment of onchain lending has emerged around segregated collateral models, where supplied assets are escrowed and never lent out to other borrowers. This approach has been particularly favored for bluechip collateral assets, such as BTC wrappers, where borrowers tend to prioritize risk isolation, predictable liquidity, and the elimination of counterparty exposure over maximizing supply yield.</p>\n<p>As onchain lending matures and borrower preferences diversify, supporting both pooled and segregated collateral experiences becomes increasingly important. Introducing segregated bluechip E-Modes allows Aave to participate in this growing segment, expand its addressable borrower base, and capture demand from users who prefer an escrowed collateral model, while preserving the existing pooled markets for users who continue to value capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>Our recommendation is to support the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes for WETH, cbBTC, and WBTC on Core, Arbitrum and Base instances as a complementary option to existing pooled markets. This approach expands the protocol design space without disrupting current users, improves risk segmentation, and allows Aave to better serve heterogeneous borrower preferences.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-terminology-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-terminology-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Terminology</strong></h1>\n<p>This section defines the core terminology used throughout the analysis to ensure a shared and consistent understanding of the concepts discussed. The distinction between segregated and pooled collateral models is central to this proposal, and clarifying these terms upfront is intended to avoid ambiguity and ensure that subsequent discussion, evaluation, and governance deliberation are grounded in a common conceptual framework.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-non-rehypothecated-collateral-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-non-rehypothecated-collateral-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Segregated (Non Rehypothecated) Collateral</h2>\n<p>Segregated collateral refers to a lending design in which supplied assets are escrowed and not lent out to other borrowers under any circumstances. Collateral supplied under this model remains fully segregated and continuously available, regardless of market utilization or borrowing activity elsewhere in the protocol.</p>\n<p>From the borrower perspective, this structure ensures that collateral can always be withdrawn immediately upon loan repayment, without dependency on external liquidity conditions. From the protocol and liquidator perspective, escrowed collateral is always available to facilitate timely liquidations when positions approach or breach required collateralization thresholds. As a result, liquidity availability for withdrawals and liquidation execution is guaranteed by design.</p>\n<p>The primary tradeoff of this model is reduced capital efficiency. Because escrowed collateral is not deployed elsewhere in the system, it does not generate yield for the supplier, and borrowing costs are not offset by supply side interest.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-pooled-rehypothecated-collateral-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-pooled-rehypothecated-collateral-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Pooled (Rehypothecated) Collateral</h2>\n<p>Pooled collateral refers to the traditional lending model used by Aave and most onchain money markets, where supplied assets are pooled and made available for borrowing by other users. In this structure, collateral backing a loan is not held idle but is instead lent out within the protocol to support additional borrowing activity.</p>\n<p>This design enables higher capital efficiency by allowing supplied assets to generate yield, which in turn lowers net borrowing costs for users and supports deeper, more liquid markets across multiple asset pairs. Pooled collateral models are therefore well suited for users who value yield generation and capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>However, because collateral is actively deployed, its availability is subject to overall market utilization. In periods of high utilization, collateral may not be immediately withdrawable, and liquidation execution relies on sufficient available liquidity within the pool. As a result, lenders and the protocol implicitly take on additional liquidity and counterparty exposure relative to segregated collateral models, all else being equal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-motivation-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The onchain lending market has reached a meaningful scale, with total active loans across chains and lending protocols amounting to approximately $36.7 billion. The majority of this activity continues to be concentrated in pooled lending markets. Approximately 81% of total active loans, or roughly $30 billion, are issued against rehypothecated collateral structures.</p>\n<p>Within this segment, Aave represents the dominant share. Aave accounts for approximately 62% of total active onchain loans and roughly 76% of all loans issued against rehypothecated collateral. This highlights both Aave\u2019s central role in the pooled lending ecosystem and its strong product market fit for capital efficient, rehypothecated lending models.</p>\n<p>In contrast, lending activity backed by segregated, escrowed collateral remains smaller in absolute terms but is far from negligible. Active loans issued against segregated collateral currently total approximately $6.8 billion. While this represents a minority share of the overall lending market, it reflects a distinct and growing user preference for non rehypothecated collateral designs.</p>\n<p>Growth trends over the past year further reinforce this observation. Active loans issued through pooled lending protocols increased by approximately 56%, while active loans issued through segregated lending protocols increased by approximately 90% over the same period. The higher percentage growth observed in segregated lending is partly attributable to its smaller starting base. In absolute terms, however, pooled lending protocols, driven primarily by Aave, accounted for the larger share of net growth in active loans.</p>\n<p>Recent upgrades in Aave v3.6 introduce additional flexibility that enables clearer separation of collateral behaviors and more granular market configurations, making factual collateral segregation feasible where it was previously constrained. This expanded design space allows Aave to serve a broader range of borrower preferences without disrupting existing pooled markets.</p>\n<p>Taken together, these trends indicate that segregated collateral lending is evolving from a niche design into a meaningful and expanding segment of onchain credit markets. While pooled rehypothecated lending remains dominant, demand for escrowed collateral structures is growing steadily. The primary motivation for this proposal is therefore to enable Aave to participate in this segment, capture emerging demand, and extend its market leadership to users who prefer segregated collateral experiences, while continuing to support and preserve its core pooled lending markets.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b762a2adbc56cea92e84a543b8d06c4a6d4bd165.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qaiHyMNwsle7oXjWsVr7ME5p8Gh.png?dl=1\" title=\"image (3)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b762a2adbc56cea92e84a543b8d06c4a6d4bd165.png\" alt=\"image (3)\" data-base62-sha1=\"qaiHyMNwsle7oXjWsVr7ME5p8Gh\" width=\"1010\" height=\"725\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-high-level-design-and-implementation-approach-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-high-level-design-and-implementation-approach-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>High Level Design and Implementation Approach</h1>\n<p>This section outlines a high level design for enabling segregated bluechip collateral borrowing on Aave v3 without modifying the core pooled markets. The intent is to describe the conceptual mechanism from a risk management perspective, while leaving smart contract implementation details, security considerations, and final architectural decisions to relevant contributors.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-conceptual-architecture-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-conceptual-architecture-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conceptual Architecture</h2>\n<p>At a high level, the segregated collateral experience can be implemented by introducing wrapper assets for each targeted bluechip collateral. These wrapper assets are designed solely to represent escrowed collateral positions and to ensure that the underlying asset is not made available for borrowing.</p>\n<p><strong>Wrapper Contracts and Segregated Wrapper Assets</strong></p>\n<p>For each asset covered in this proposal, a dedicated wrapper contract would accept deposits of the underlying token and mint a corresponding segregated wrapper token (sToken) on a 1:1 basis.</p>\n<p>Examples include the following mappings.</p>\n<p>WETH to sWETH<br>\ncbBTC to scbBTC<br>\nWBTC to sWBTC</p>\n<p>The wrapper naming and symbols are illustrative and can be finalized during implementation. The core requirement is that each wrapper token is always and immediately redeemable for its underlying at a 1:1 rate, similar to the WETH9 implementation and with minimal functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>Aave v3 Listings and Collateral Configuration</strong></p>\n<p>The segregated wrapper assets would then be listed on Aave v3 as collateral and configured as non-borrowable. This configuration ensures that the supplied collateral cannot be borrowed by other users, which is the central property required to prevent rehypothecation.</p>\n<p>From the user perspective, supplying the segregated wrapper asset should function similarly to supplying any other collateral, with the distinction that the supplied balance is not part of the borrowable liquidity pool and is only usable as collateral within its designated E-Mode category.</p>\n<p><strong>E-Mode Configuration and Stablecoin Access</strong></p>\n<p>To preserve existing liquidity and user experience for stablecoin borrowing, the proposal relies on E-Mode categories that allow segregated wrapper collateral to access the existing core stablecoin markets.</p>\n<p>Concretely, the design would introduce dedicated E-Mode categories that include the segregated wrapper collateral assets and the relevant stablecoin borrow assets already listed on the instance.</p>\n<p>This approach allows segregated collateral users to borrow from the existing deep stablecoin reserves.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-user-flow-and-integration-at-a-high-level-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-user-flow-and-integration-at-a-high-level-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>User Flow and Integration at a High Level</h2>\n<p>From a user flow perspective, the mechanism can be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p>A user who opts into the segregated pathway deposits WETH, cbBTC, or WBTC. The corresponding wrapper contract receives the deposited asset and mints a segregated wrapper token (sToken) on a 1:1 basis. The minted sToken is then supplied to Aave on behalf of the user, where it functions exclusively as collateral in E-mode and cannot be borrowed by other participants.</p>\n<p>When the user repays their debt and withdraws collateral, the flow reverses. The wrapper token is withdrawn from Aave, burned in exchange for the underlying, and the underlying token is returned to the user.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-pricing-and-oracle-considerations-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-pricing-and-oracle-considerations-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Pricing and Oracle Considerations</h2>\n<p>The segregated wrapper assets are intended to maintain strict 1:1 parity with their underlying tokens, as they are simple proxy contracts. As a result, the wrapper assets should be priced identically to their underlying assets. This can be achieved by reusing the existing oracle configuration for the underlying assets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-user-experience-and-interface-considerations-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-user-experience-and-interface-considerations-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>User Experience and Interface Considerations</h1>\n<p>The introduction of segregated bluechip collaterals is intended to have minimal impact on the existing Aave user experience and interface. The proposal is designed to extend current functionality rather than alter existing workflows, ensuring that users who prefer pooled markets can continue interacting with the protocol without disruption.</p>\n<p>From a frontend perspective, the segregated wrapper assets (sTokens) would be listed alongside existing assets in the Aave interface, following the same conventions used for other listed tokens. Each wrapper asset would be clearly labeled to reflect its segregated nature, for example sWETH \u2013 Segregated Wrapped Ether, scbBTC \u2013 Segregated Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin, and sWBTC \u2013 Segregated Wrapped Bitcoin. This naming convention is intended to provide immediate clarity to users regarding the collateral treatment of these assets.</p>\n<p>User interaction flows would remain consistent with current behavior. Supplying segregated collateral, entering the relevant E-Mode, borrowing stablecoins, and managing positions would follow the same steps and interface patterns already familiar to Aave users. The primary difference is the explicit choice at deposit time between supplying the underlying asset into the pooled market or into its segregated counterpart.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-risk-and-benefit-assessment-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-risk-and-benefit-assessment-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk and Benefit Assessment</strong></h1>\n<p>This section outlines the primary benefits and risks associated with the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes, with a focus on protocol level considerations, borrower outcomes, and potential second order effects.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-benefits-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-benefits-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Benefits</h3>\n<p>The proposal enables Aave v3 to directly participate in the growing segment of segregated collateral lending within the broader borrow lend ecosystem. While pooled lending remains dominant, segregated collateral borrowing is exhibiting sustained growth, and supporting this design allows Aave to capture incremental demand rather than ceding this segment to alternative protocols.</p>\n<p>Certainty around liquidity availability materially improves the risk profile of segregated collateral positions. Because collateral is escrowed and never rehypothecated, the protocol can safely support higher borrowing power through better LTV and LT configurations, improving competitiveness for borrowers.</p>\n<p>Guaranteed liquidity availability also ensures that liquidations are not halted or delayed during periods of market volatility due to elevated utilization. This removes a key execution risk present in pooled markets when market approaches full utilization levels and supports more predictable system behavior under stress.</p>\n<p>Lastly, borrowers using segregated collateral also avoid counterparty exposure to other borrowers. Since collateral is not lent out, borrowers are insulated from risks associated with third party defaults or liquidity shortfalls elsewhere in the protocol, resulting in a clearer and more contained risk profile.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-risks-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-risks-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risks</strong></h3>\n<p>The primary risk associated with this proposal relates to potential liquidity migration from pooled markets to segregated markets, particularly for ETH collateral. ETH is a highly utilized market and serves as foundational liquidity supporting large LST and LRT borrowing activity. A meaningful migration of existing ETH supply from pooled markets into segregated configurations could reduce available liquidity for LST and LRT markets and negatively impact overall protocol revenue.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this risk, segregated ETH E-Modes should be introduced with tighter initial supply caps relative to BTC based segregated configurations and monitored closely following deployment. This approach allows governance to observe whether segregated E-Modes are primarily attracting new borrowing demand or instead incentivizing migration of existing positions from pooled markets. Parameter adjustments and caps can then be iteratively refined based on observed usage patterns and their impact on broader market health.</p>\n<p>Overall, while the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes introduces a tradeoff between borrowing power, capital efficiency and risk isolation, the proposed design, combined with conservative rollout parameters and active monitoring, allows Aave to explore this design space without materially compromising the stability or profitability of existing pooled markets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-lt-configuration-considerations-for-segregated-markets-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-lt-configuration-considerations-for-segregated-markets-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>LT Configuration Considerations for Segregated Markets</strong></h1>\n<p>The recommended thresholds are outputs of Chaos Labs VaR-based simulation frameworks that evaluate downside price moves and liquidation feasibility under a range of market conditions, including stressed environments.</p>\n<p>While the specific modeling assumptions and parameterization are subject to refinement and implementation level review, the key calibration intuition is straightforward. In segregated configurations, collateral is escrowed and not rehypothecated, which improves certainty around collateral availability during liquidation events. In addition, collateral is segregated from pooled liquidity dynamics and is not cross margined with broader pool utilization, reducing reliance on external liquidity conditions for liquidation execution. Together, these factors meaningfully reduce liquidation execution risk and limit second-order effects that can arise when collateral is deployed elsewhere in the system.</p>\n<p>As a result, the protocol can support higher borrowing power for these assets relative to pooled configurations while maintaining conservative liquidation safety margins. The proposed LT values are therefore designed to reflect the improved predictability of liquidation execution and collateral accessibility in segregated markets, while still accounting for underlying price volatility, liquidity conditions of borrow assets, and the operational realities of liquidation execution.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-cross-margin-restrictions-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-cross-margin-restrictions-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Cross Margin Restrictions</strong></h1>\n<p>In historical implementations of E-Modes, the protocol fully isolated parameterized debt assets via the E-Mode mask; however, users could hypothetically add non-whitelisted collateral assets to the aggregate position and borrow E-Mode-whitelisted borrowable assets. This led to aggregated position health being dictated by an effectively cross-margined collateral position, complicating the dynamics surrounding factual isolation.</p>\n<p>With the launch of v3.6, there is now a practical path to pure isolation and to strictly preventing cross-margin within the proposed Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes. Specifically, any collateral asset that is not part of a given E-Mode is configured with a maximum LTV of 0 when that E-Mode is active. This ensures that users who already maintain cross-margin positions, where stablecoins are borrowed against a combination of wrapped bluechip and non bluechip collateral, cannot activate the Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode to improve their health factor, which is explicitly designed to operate without cross-margin exposure.</p>\n<p>Operationally, this requires enumerating all collateral assets that are outside the scope of each Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode and assigning them an LTV of 0 within that E-Mode. To avoid excessive table expansion and to maintain readability, these assets are grouped under an \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d category in the specification tables, with the full list disclosed in the section below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-16\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assets Configured as \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d</strong></h2>\n<p>The following lists of collateral assets that are configured with LTV0 within each Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-17\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Segregated ETH Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-18\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Segregated BTC Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WBTC, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, CBETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-recommendation-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-recommendation-19\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Recommendation</h1>\n<p>We recommend the introduction of segregated bluechip stablecoin E-Modes on Aave v3, supported by the listing of dedicated segregated wrapper assets and conservative initial configuration parameters.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we recommend listing segregated wrapper assets (sTokens) for bluechip collateral and enabling their use exclusively within dedicated segregated stablecoin E-Modes. This includes the listing of sWETH, scbBTC, and sWBTC, with each asset configured as non borrowable and usable as collateral only within its designated E-Mode.

These configurations are designed to allow users to opt into a borrowing environment where supplied collateral is not rehypothecated, thereby eliminating liquidity and liquidation execution risk arising from rehypothecation, removing borrower exposure to counterparty default risk, and enabling more competitive risk parameterization.</p>\n<p>Historically, Aave has mostly relied on a pooled collateral model in which supplied assets are rehypothecated to support capital efficient lending markets. This design has formed the foundation of Aave\u2019s growth and remains the dominant structure across onchain lending today. In parallel, relatively small but steadily growing segment of onchain lending has emerged around segregated collateral models, where supplied assets are escrowed and never lent out to other borrowers. This approach has been particularly favored for bluechip collateral assets, such as BTC wrappers, where borrowers tend to prioritize risk isolation, predictable liquidity, and the elimination of counterparty exposure over maximizing supply yield.</p>\n<p>As onchain lending matures and borrower preferences diversify, supporting both pooled and segregated collateral experiences becomes increasingly important. Introducing segregated bluechip E-Modes allows Aave to participate in this growing segment, expand its addressable borrower base, and capture demand from users who prefer an escrowed collateral model, while preserving the existing pooled markets for users who continue to value capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>Our recommendation is to support the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes for WETH, cbBTC, and WBTC on Core, Arbitrum and Base instances as a complementary option to existing pooled markets. This approach expands the protocol design space without disrupting current users, improves risk segmentation, and allows Aave to better serve heterogeneous borrower preferences.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-terminology-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-terminology-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Terminology</strong></h1>\n<p>This section defines the core terminology used throughout the analysis to ensure a shared and consistent understanding of the concepts discussed. The distinction between segregated and pooled collateral models is central to this proposal, and clarifying these terms upfront is intended to avoid ambiguity and ensure that subsequent discussion, evaluation, and governance deliberation are grounded in a common conceptual framework.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-non-rehypothecated-collateral-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-non-rehypothecated-collateral-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Segregated (Non Rehypothecated) Collateral</h2>\n<p>Segregated collateral refers to a lending design in which supplied assets are escrowed and not lent out to other borrowers under any circumstances. Collateral supplied under this model remains fully segregated and continuously available, regardless of market utilization or borrowing activity elsewhere in the protocol.</p>\n<p>From the borrower perspective, this structure ensures that collateral can always be withdrawn immediately upon loan repayment, without dependency on external liquidity conditions. From the protocol and liquidator perspective, escrowed collateral is always available to facilitate timely liquidations when positions approach or breach required collateralization thresholds. As a result, liquidity availability for withdrawals and liquidation execution is guaranteed by design.</p>\n<p>The primary tradeoff of this model is reduced capital efficiency. Because escrowed collateral is not deployed elsewhere in the system, it does not generate yield for the supplier, and borrowing costs are not offset by supply side interest.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-pooled-rehypothecated-collateral-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-pooled-rehypothecated-collateral-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Pooled (Rehypothecated) Collateral</h2>\n<p>Pooled collateral refers to the traditional lending model used by Aave and most onchain money markets, where supplied assets are pooled and made available for borrowing by other users. In this structure, collateral backing a loan is not held idle but is instead lent out within the protocol to support additional borrowing activity.</p>\n<p>This design enables higher capital efficiency by allowing supplied assets to generate yield, which in turn lowers net borrowing costs for users and supports deeper, more liquid markets across multiple asset pairs. Pooled collateral models are therefore well suited for users who value yield generation and capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>However, because collateral is actively deployed, its availability is subject to overall market utilization. In periods of high utilization, collateral may not be immediately withdrawable, and liquidation execution relies on sufficient available liquidity within the pool. As a result, lenders and the protocol implicitly take on additional liquidity and counterparty exposure relative to segregated collateral models, all else being equal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-motivation-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The onchain lending market has reached a meaningful scale, with total active loans across chains and lending protocols amounting to approximately $36.7 billion. The majority of this activity continues to be concentrated in pooled lending markets. Approximately 81% of total active loans, or roughly $30 billion, are issued against rehypothecated collateral structures.</p>\n<p>Within this segment, Aave represents the dominant share. Aave accounts for approximately 62% of total active onchain loans and roughly 76% of all loans issued against rehypothecated collateral. This highlights both Aave\u2019s central role in the pooled lending ecosystem and its strong product market fit for capital efficient, rehypothecated lending models.</p>\n<p>In contrast, lending activity backed by segregated, escrowed collateral remains smaller in absolute terms but is far from negligible. Active loans issued against segregated collateral currently total approximately $6.8 billion. While this represents a minority share of the overall lending market, it reflects a distinct and growing user preference for non rehypothecated collateral designs.</p>\n<p>Growth trends over the past year further reinforce this observation. Active loans issued through pooled lending protocols increased by approximately 56%, while active loans issued through segregated lending protocols increased by approximately 90% over the same period. The higher percentage growth observed in segregated lending is partly attributable to its smaller starting base. In absolute terms, however, pooled lending protocols, driven primarily by Aave, accounted for the larger share of net growth in active loans.</p>\n<p>Recent upgrades in Aave v3.6 introduce additional flexibility that enables clearer separation of collateral behaviors and more granular market configurations, making factual collateral segregation feasible where it was previously constrained. This expanded design space allows Aave to serve a broader range of borrower preferences without disrupting existing pooled markets.</p>\n<p>Taken together, these trends indicate that segregated collateral lending is evolving from a niche design into a meaningful and expanding segment of onchain credit markets. While pooled rehypothecated lending remains dominant, demand for escrowed collateral structures is growing steadily. The primary motivation for this proposal is therefore to enable Aave to participate in this segment, capture emerging demand, and extend its market leadership to users who prefer segregated collateral experiences, while continuing to support and preserve its core pooled lending markets.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b762a2adbc56cea92e84a543b8d06c4a6d4bd165.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qaiHyMNwsle7oXjWsVr7ME5p8Gh.png?dl=1\" title=\"image (3)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b762a2adbc56cea92e84a543b8d06c4a6d4bd165.png\" alt=\"image (3)\" data-base62-sha1=\"qaiHyMNwsle7oXjWsVr7ME5p8Gh\" width=\"1010\" height=\"725\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-high-level-design-and-implementation-approach-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-high-level-design-and-implementation-approach-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>High Level Design and Implementation Approach</h1>\n<p>This section outlines a high level design for enabling segregated bluechip collateral borrowing on Aave v3 without modifying the core pooled markets. The intent is to describe the conceptual mechanism from a risk management perspective, while leaving smart contract implementation details, security considerations, and final architectural decisions to relevant contributors.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-conceptual-architecture-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-conceptual-architecture-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conceptual Architecture</h2>\n<p>At a high level, the segregated collateral experience can be implemented by introducing wrapper assets for each targeted bluechip collateral. These wrapper assets are designed solely to represent escrowed collateral positions and to ensure that the underlying asset is not made available for borrowing.</p>\n<p><strong>Wrapper Contracts and Segregated Wrapper Assets</strong></p>\n<p>For each asset covered in this proposal, a dedicated wrapper contract would accept deposits of the underlying token and mint a corresponding segregated wrapper token (sToken) on a 1:1 basis.</p>\n<p>Examples include the following mappings.</p>\n<p>WETH to sWETH<br>\ncbBTC to scbBTC<br>\nWBTC to sWBTC</p>\n<p>The wrapper naming and symbols are illustrative and can be finalized during implementation. The core requirement is that each wrapper token is always and immediately redeemable for its underlying at a 1:1 rate, similar to the WETH9 implementation and with minimal functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>Aave v3 Listings and Collateral Configuration</strong></p>\n<p>The segregated wrapper assets would then be listed on Aave v3 as collateral and configured as non-borrowable. This configuration ensures that the supplied collateral cannot be borrowed by other users, which is the central property required to prevent rehypothecation.</p>\n<p>From the user perspective, supplying the segregated wrapper asset should function similarly to supplying any other collateral, with the distinction that the supplied balance is not part of the borrowable liquidity pool and is only usable as collateral within its designated E-Mode category.</p>\n<p><strong>E-Mode Configuration and Stablecoin Access</strong></p>\n<p>To preserve existing liquidity and user experience for stablecoin borrowing, the proposal relies on E-Mode categories that allow segregated wrapper collateral to access the existing core stablecoin markets.</p>\n<p>Concretely, the design would introduce dedicated E-Mode categories that include the segregated wrapper collateral assets and the relevant stablecoin borrow assets already listed on the instance.</p>\n<p>This approach allows segregated collateral users to borrow from the existing deep stablecoin reserves.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-user-flow-and-integration-at-a-high-level-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-user-flow-and-integration-at-a-high-level-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>User Flow and Integration at a High Level</h2>\n<p>From a user flow perspective, the mechanism can be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p>A user who opts into the segregated pathway deposits WETH, cbBTC, or WBTC. The corresponding wrapper contract receives the deposited asset and mints a segregated wrapper token (sToken) on a 1:1 basis. The minted sToken is then supplied to Aave on behalf of the user, where it functions exclusively as collateral in E-mode and cannot be borrowed by other participants.</p>\n<p>When the user repays their debt and withdraws collateral, the flow reverses. The wrapper token is withdrawn from Aave, burned in exchange for the underlying, and the underlying token is returned to the user.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-pricing-and-oracle-considerations-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-pricing-and-oracle-considerations-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Pricing and Oracle Considerations</h2>\n<p>The segregated wrapper assets are intended to maintain strict 1:1 parity with their underlying tokens, as they are simple proxy contracts. As a result, the wrapper assets should be priced identically to their underlying assets. This can be achieved by reusing the existing oracle configuration for the underlying assets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-user-experience-and-interface-considerations-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-user-experience-and-interface-considerations-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>User Experience and Interface Considerations</h1>\n<p>The introduction of segregated bluechip collaterals is intended to have minimal impact on the existing Aave user experience and interface. The proposal is designed to extend current functionality rather than alter existing workflows, ensuring that users who prefer pooled markets can continue interacting with the protocol without disruption.</p>\n<p>From a frontend perspective, the segregated wrapper assets (sTokens) would be listed alongside existing assets in the Aave interface, following the same conventions used for other listed tokens. Each wrapper asset would be clearly labeled to reflect its segregated nature, for example sWETH \u2013 Segregated Wrapped Ether, scbBTC \u2013 Segregated Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin, and sWBTC \u2013 Segregated Wrapped Bitcoin. This naming convention is intended to provide immediate clarity to users regarding the collateral treatment of these assets.</p>\n<p>User interaction flows would remain consistent with current behavior. Supplying segregated collateral, entering the relevant E-Mode, borrowing stablecoins, and managing positions would follow the same steps and interface patterns already familiar to Aave users. The primary difference is the explicit choice at deposit time between supplying the underlying asset into the pooled market or into its segregated counterpart.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-risk-and-benefit-assessment-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-risk-and-benefit-assessment-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk and Benefit Assessment</strong></h1>\n<p>This section outlines the primary benefits and risks associated with the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes, with a focus on protocol level considerations, borrower outcomes, and potential second order effects.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-benefits-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-benefits-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Benefits</h3>\n<p>The proposal enables Aave v3 to directly participate in the growing segment of segregated collateral lending within the broader borrow lend ecosystem. While pooled lending remains dominant, segregated collateral borrowing is exhibiting sustained growth, and supporting this design allows Aave to capture incremental demand rather than ceding this segment to alternative protocols.</p>\n<p>Certainty around liquidity availability materially improves the risk profile of segregated collateral positions. Because collateral is escrowed and never rehypothecated, the protocol can safely support higher borrowing power through better LTV and LT configurations, improving competitiveness for borrowers.</p>\n<p>Guaranteed liquidity availability also ensures that liquidations are not halted or delayed during periods of market volatility due to elevated utilization. This removes a key execution risk present in pooled markets when market approaches full utilization levels and supports more predictable system behavior under stress.</p>\n<p>Lastly, borrowers using segregated collateral also avoid counterparty exposure to other borrowers. Since collateral is not lent out, borrowers are insulated from risks associated with third party defaults or liquidity shortfalls elsewhere in the protocol, resulting in a clearer and more contained risk profile.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-risks-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-risks-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risks</strong></h3>\n<p>The primary risk associated with this proposal relates to potential liquidity migration from pooled markets to segregated markets, particularly for ETH collateral. ETH is a highly utilized market and serves as foundational liquidity supporting large LST and LRT borrowing activity. A meaningful migration of existing ETH supply from pooled markets into segregated configurations could reduce available liquidity for LST and LRT markets and negatively impact overall protocol revenue.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this risk, segregated ETH E-Modes should be introduced with tighter initial supply caps relative to BTC based segregated configurations and monitored closely following deployment. This approach allows governance to observe whether segregated E-Modes are primarily attracting new borrowing demand or instead incentivizing migration of existing positions from pooled markets. Parameter adjustments and caps can then be iteratively refined based on observed usage patterns and their impact on broader market health.</p>\n<p>Overall, while the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes introduces a tradeoff between borrowing power, capital efficiency and risk isolation, the proposed design, combined with conservative rollout parameters and active monitoring, allows Aave to explore this design space without materially compromising the stability or profitability of existing pooled markets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-lt-configuration-considerations-for-segregated-markets-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-lt-configuration-considerations-for-segregated-markets-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>LT Configuration Considerations for Segregated Markets</strong></h1>\n<p>The recommended thresholds are outputs of Chaos Labs VaR-based simulation frameworks that evaluate downside price moves and liquidation feasibility under a range of market conditions, including stressed environments.</p>\n<p>While the specific modeling assumptions and parameterization are subject to refinement and implementation level review, the key calibration intuition is straightforward. In segregated configurations, collateral is escrowed and not rehypothecated, which improves certainty around collateral availability during liquidation events. In addition, collateral is segregated from pooled liquidity dynamics and is not cross margined with broader pool utilization, reducing reliance on external liquidity conditions for liquidation execution. Together, these factors meaningfully reduce liquidation execution risk and limit second-order effects that can arise when collateral is deployed elsewhere in the system.</p>\n<p>As a result, the protocol can support higher borrowing power for these assets relative to pooled configurations while maintaining conservative liquidation safety margins. The proposed LT values are therefore designed to reflect the improved predictability of liquidation execution and collateral accessibility in segregated markets, while still accounting for underlying price volatility, liquidity conditions of borrow assets, and the operational realities of liquidation execution.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-cross-margin-restrictions-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-cross-margin-restrictions-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Cross Margin Restrictions</strong></h1>\n<p>In historical implementations of E-Modes, the protocol fully isolated parameterized debt assets via the E-Mode mask; however, users could hypothetically add non-whitelisted collateral assets to the aggregate position and borrow E-Mode-whitelisted borrowable assets. This led to aggregated position health being dictated by an effectively cross-margined collateral position, complicating the dynamics surrounding factual isolation.</p>\n<p>With the launch of v3.6, there is now a practical path to pure isolation and to strictly preventing cross-margin within the proposed Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes. Specifically, any collateral asset that is not part of a given E-Mode is configured with a maximum LTV of 0 when that E-Mode is active. This ensures that users who already maintain cross-margin positions, where stablecoins are borrowed against a combination of wrapped bluechip and non bluechip collateral, cannot activate the Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode to improve their health factor, which is explicitly designed to operate without cross-margin exposure.</p>\n<p>Operationally, this requires enumerating all collateral assets that are outside the scope of each Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode and assigning them an LTV of 0 within that E-Mode. To avoid excessive table expansion and to maintain readability, these assets are grouped under an \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d category in the specification tables, with the full list disclosed in the section below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-16\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assets Configured as \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d</strong></h2>\n<p>The following lists of collateral assets that are configured with LTV0 within each Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-17\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Segregated ETH Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-18\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Segregated BTC Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WBTC, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, CBETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-recommendation-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-recommendation-19\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Recommendation</h1>\n<p>We recommend the introduction of segregated bluechip stablecoin E-Modes on Aave v3, supported by the listing of dedicated segregated wrapper assets and conservative initial configuration parameters.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we recommend listing segregated wrapper assets (sTokens) for bluechip collateral and enabling their use exclusively within dedicated segregated stablecoin E-Modes.

These E-Modes are designed to enable stablecoin borrowing under a isolated risk parameterization.</p>\n<p>By isolating stablecoin borrowing within dedicated E-Modes, the protocol can offer improved capital efficiency for borrowers without expanding exposure beyond stablecoin debt against bluechip collateral assets. The flexibility introduced in v3.6 allows these E-Mode configurations to be adjusted or deprecated if conditions deteriorate, without impacting the underlying market parameterization or broader risk profile of the base asset markets.</p>\n<p>This approach aligns with a protocol wide risk posture, balancing enhanced borrower efficiency with clearer risk boundaries.</p>\n<p>On Base, where a cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode with matching risk parameters already exists, the proposal modifies the existing E-Mode rather than creating a new one.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-rationale-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-rationale-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>Across major Aave v3 deployments, the primary use case for WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC as collateral is stablecoin borrowing.</p>\n<p>On Ethereum mainnet, more than 95% of the borrowing activity backed by WETH is denominated in stablecoins, primarily USDT and USDC. In addition, the majority of WETH suppliers use WETH as their sole collateral asset and do not opt into cross margin exposure within the Core market.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9b52836abf43a825a8224b666c19654c4f036936.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ma2N6gd8uYcvPur8tryOnqNCsuy.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9b52836abf43a825a8224b666c19654c4f036936.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ma2N6gd8uYcvPur8tryOnqNCsuy\" width=\"620\" height=\"430\"></a></div><br>\nBorrow Against Distribution of WETH - Core Market<p></p>\n<p>A similar pattern is observed for WBTC and cbBTC. Borrowing activity backed by WBTC on Core markets exceeds 95% in stablecoins, while cbBTC exhibits a stablecoin borrowing share above 90%. These patterns indicate that volatile asset borrowing is not a material driver of demand for bluechip collateral, and that stablecoin access represents the dominant and persistent use case.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/f6ee7b1ae099551c34698149471ae3641f35c5d5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zesoQ7MlPfCYf9lfQ1gdLz1NfxP.png?dl=1\" title=\"image (1)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/f6ee7b1ae099551c34698149471ae3641f35c5d5.png\" alt=\"image (1)\" data-base62-sha1=\"zesoQ7MlPfCYf9lfQ1gdLz1NfxP\" width=\"619\" height=\"432\"></a></div><br>\nBorrow Against Distribution of WBTC- Core Market<p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/ee8c16e73d5c9e2468ddec32ec8959a2b1d3ceb0.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/y2hMfDXHt5mxm6Yuq0zPR89Xp7y.png?dl=1\" title=\"image (2)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/ee8c16e73d5c9e2468ddec32ec8959a2b1d3ceb0.png\" alt=\"image (2)\" data-base62-sha1=\"y2hMfDXHt5mxm6Yuq0zPR89Xp7y\" width=\"623\" height=\"424\"></a></div><br>\nBorrow Against Distribution of cbBTC- Core Market<p></p>\n<p>Given this observed behavior, introducing isolated stablecoin E-Modes allows the protocol to better align risk parameterization with actual usage. By constraining borrowing to stablecoins while maintaining access to deep stablecoin markets for these bluechip collaterals, these E-Modes can support higher capital efficiency for borrowers without introducing additional exposure to reflexive debt.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-cross-margin-restrictions-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-cross-margin-restrictions-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Cross Margin Restrictions</strong></h1>\n<p>In historical implementations of E-Modes, the protocol fully isolated parameterized debt assets via the E-Mode mask; however, users could hypothetically add non-whitelisted collateral assets to the aggregate position and borrow E-Mode-whitelisted borrowable assets. This led to aggregated position health being dictated by an effectively cross-margined collateral position, complicating the dynamics surrounding factual isolation.</p>\n<p>With the launch of v3.6, there is now a practical path to pure isolation and to strictly preventing cross-margin within the proposed Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes. Specifically, any collateral asset that is not part of a given E-Mode is configured with a maximum LTV of 0 when that E-Mode is active. This ensures that users who already maintain cross-margin positions, where stablecoins are borrowed against a combination of wrapped bluechip and non bluechip collateral, cannot activate the Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode to improve their health factor, which is explicitly designed to operate without cross-margin exposure.</p>\n<p>Operationally, this requires enumerating all collateral assets that are outside the scope of each Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode and assigning them an LTV of 0 within that E-Mode. To avoid excessive table expansion and to maintain readability, these assets are grouped under an \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d category in the specification tables, with the full list disclosed in the section below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assets Configured as \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d</strong></h2>\n<p>The following lists of collateral assets that are configured with LTV0 within each Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61209-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>ETH Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WSTETH, WBTC, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Avalanche</strong><br>\nEURC, DAI.e, BTC.b, WAVAX, USDE, SUSDE, AUSD, LINK.e, AAVE.e, WBTC.e, sAVAX</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>CBETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61209-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>BTC Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE, EZETH</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-modification-of-the-existing-cbbtc-e-mode-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-modification-of-the-existing-cbbtc-e-mode-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Modification of the Existing cbBTC E-Mode</strong></h1>\n<p>For all deployments covered in this proposal, new Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes are introduced. The sole exception is the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode on Base, where an equivalent E-Mode already exists with matching risk parameters. In this case, the proposal does not introduce a new E-Mode, but instead modifies the existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode to achieve strict collateral isolation.</p>\n<p>The existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode on Base allows stablecoin borrowing against cbBTC with an LT of 83%. However, collateral assets outside the E-Mode are not currently subject to the LTV0 rule, which permits users to maintain cross-margin positions by combining cbBTC with other collateral assets. Creating a new E-Mode to enforce collateral isolation would require migrating existing user debt, which would introduce unnecessary friction and negatively impact user experience.</p>\n<p>Instead, this proposal preserves the existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode and its parameters, while extending the configuration to include all non E-Mode collateral assets with LTV set to 0. This change enforces true collateral isolation without requiring any migration of existing positions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-impact-on-existing-cross-margin-positions-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-impact-on-existing-cross-margin-positions-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Impact on Existing Cross-Margin Positions</strong></h2>\n<p>For users who currently have the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode active while also supplying additional collateral assets outside of the E-Mode, the following mechanics apply after the modification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All collateral assets outside of the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode will be added to the E-Mode with maximum LTV set to 0.</li>\n<li>These assets will inherit the E-Mode LT of 83%.</li>\n<li>Health Factor may increase, as some of these assets has reserve level LT below 83%.</li>\n<li>Borrowing power will not increase, since the LTV0 rule.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Importantly, while Health Factor may improve, users will not be able to increase borrowing.

These E-Modes are designed to enable stablecoin borrowing under a isolated risk parameterization.</p>\n<p>By isolating stablecoin borrowing within dedicated E-Modes, the protocol can offer improved capital efficiency for borrowers without expanding exposure beyond stablecoin debt against bluechip collateral assets. The flexibility introduced in v3.6 allows these E-Mode configurations to be adjusted or deprecated if conditions deteriorate, without impacting the underlying market parameterization or broader risk profile of the base asset markets.</p>\n<p>This approach aligns with a protocol wide risk posture, balancing enhanced borrower efficiency with clearer risk boundaries.</p>\n<p>On Base, where a cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode with matching risk parameters already exists, the proposal modifies the existing E-Mode rather than creating a new one.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-rationale-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-rationale-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>Across major Aave v3 deployments, the primary use case for WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC as collateral is stablecoin borrowing.</p>\n<p>On Ethereum mainnet, more than 95% of the borrowing activity backed by WETH is denominated in stablecoins, primarily USDT and USDC. In addition, the majority of WETH suppliers use WETH as their sole collateral asset and do not opt into cross margin exposure within the Core market.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9b52836abf43a825a8224b666c19654c4f036936.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ma2N6gd8uYcvPur8tryOnqNCsuy.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9b52836abf43a825a8224b666c19654c4f036936.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ma2N6gd8uYcvPur8tryOnqNCsuy\" width=\"620\" height=\"430\"></a></div><br>\nBorrow Against Distribution of WETH - Core Market<p></p>\n<p>A similar pattern is observed for WBTC and cbBTC.

By constraining borrowing to stablecoins while maintaining access to deep stablecoin markets for these bluechip collaterals, these E-Modes can support higher capital efficiency for borrowers without introducing additional exposure to reflexive debt.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-cross-margin-restrictions-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-cross-margin-restrictions-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Cross Margin Restrictions</strong></h1>\n<p>In historical implementations of E-Modes, the protocol fully isolated parameterized debt assets via the E-Mode mask; however, users could hypothetically add non-whitelisted collateral assets to the aggregate position and borrow E-Mode-whitelisted borrowable assets. This led to aggregated position health being dictated by an effectively cross-margined collateral position, complicating the dynamics surrounding factual isolation.</p>\n<p>With the launch of v3.6, there is now a practical path to pure isolation and to strictly preventing cross-margin within the proposed Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes. Specifically, any collateral asset that is not part of a given E-Mode is configured with a maximum LTV of 0 when that E-Mode is active. This ensures that users who already maintain cross-margin positions, where stablecoins are borrowed against a combination of wrapped bluechip and non bluechip collateral, cannot activate the Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode to improve their health factor, which is explicitly designed to operate without cross-margin exposure.</p>\n<p>Operationally, this requires enumerating all collateral assets that are outside the scope of each Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode and assigning them an LTV of 0 within that E-Mode. To avoid excessive table expansion and to maintain readability, these assets are grouped under an \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d category in the specification tables, with the full list disclosed in the section below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assets Configured as \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d</strong></h2>\n<p>The following lists of collateral assets that are configured with LTV0 within each Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61209-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>ETH Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WSTETH, WBTC, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Avalanche</strong><br>\nEURC, DAI.e, BTC.b, WAVAX, USDE, SUSDE, AUSD, LINK.e, AAVE.e, WBTC.e, sAVAX</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>CBETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61209-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>BTC Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE, EZETH</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-modification-of-the-existing-cbbtc-e-mode-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-modification-of-the-existing-cbbtc-e-mode-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Modification of the Existing cbBTC E-Mode</strong></h1>\n<p>For all deployments covered in this proposal, new Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes are introduced. The sole exception is the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode on Base, where an equivalent E-Mode already exists with matching risk parameters. In this case, the proposal does not introduce a new E-Mode, but instead modifies the existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode to achieve strict collateral isolation.</p>\n<p>The existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode on Base allows stablecoin borrowing against cbBTC with an LT of 83%. However, collateral assets outside the E-Mode are not currently subject to the LTV0 rule, which permits users to maintain cross-margin positions by combining cbBTC with other collateral assets. Creating a new E-Mode to enforce collateral isolation would require migrating existing user debt, which would introduce unnecessary friction and negatively impact user experience.</p>\n<p>Instead, this proposal preserves the existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode and its parameters, while extending the configuration to include all non E-Mode collateral assets with LTV set to 0.

Summary</h2>\n<p>This proposal introduces <strong>Maxshot AI</strong> to the Aave community as a complementary, value-accretive yield optimization and distribution layer.</p>\n<p>As Maxshot is already integrated with Aave V3 markets across multiple chains, this proposal does <strong>not</strong> request any protocol parameter changes, risk parameter updates, or direct integrations. Instead, it seeks community awareness, feedback, and formal ecosystem recognition of Maxshot as a third-party strategy operator that enhances capital efficiency and user experience for Aave.</p>\n<p>By leveraging AI-driven, non-discretionary agents, Maxshot simplifies access to optimized, omni-chain yield opportunities, with the goal of increasing total value locked (TVL), capital efficiency, and liquidity stickiness across Aave markets.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2. Abstract</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI operates as an intelligent yield optimization layer built on top of Aave and other DeFi protocols. It automatically routes and rebalances capital across chains and markets using deterministic, AI-driven agents to maximize risk-adjusted returns.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to align the Aave community with an existing ecosystem partner that already contributes capital flows into Aave liquidity pools and improves user access to yield opportunities without introducing additional protocol risk.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3. Motivation</h2>\n<p>Aave is a foundational DeFi liquidity protocol with robust risk management, transparent governance, and deployments across multiple networks. While its multi-chain expansion is a core strength, it also introduces structural inefficiencies that create opportunities for complementary, user-layer optimization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-challenges-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-challenges-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Key Challenges</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Fragmentation:</strong> Liquidity is distributed across multiple Aave deployments, requiring users to manually bridge assets, compare rates, and manage positions across chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> Actively managing positions across multiple markets and networks is time-intensive and costly, leading to suboptimal capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Uneven Utilization:</strong> Friction at the user layer can result in idle liquidity and inconsistent utilization across Aave markets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Maxshot\u2019s Role</h3>\n<p>Maxshot AI acts as a non-custodial, intelligent routing and optimization layer on top of Aave, improving capital efficiency and user experience through automated, rules-based yield optimization\u2014without modifying or competing with Aave\u2019s core protocol.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4. Specification: Maxshot Overview</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI Agent Factory, an AI-native, automation-first infrastructure layer designed to build, deploy, and coordinate autonomous agents for on-chain capital optimization.</p>\n<p>At its core, Maxshot provides a standardized framework for creating protocol-aware, risk-constrained AI agents that can observe market conditions, reason over strategy sets, and execute actions across DeFi systems. These agents operate continuously within predefined risk models and governance-aligned parameters, enabling scalable and transparent automation at the infrastructure level.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Key Characteristics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deterministic, Continuous Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Agents operate autonomously and continuously, responding to market changes without manual intervention. All decisions follow transparent, rules-based logic that is auditable and verifiable on-chain, eliminating discretionary risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Full On-Chain Transparency</strong></p>\n<p>Every allocation, rebalance, and performance metric is recorded on-chain and available for real-time community review, enabling ongoing verification of compliance and protocol impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Maxshot enforces a strict separation between optimization logic (Strategy Layer), safety constraints (Risk Layer), and on-chain interactions (Execution Layer). This design ensures that strategy decisions cannot bypass risk controls and that all actions remain auditable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first flagship product built on this framework is <strong>Maxshot Omni Yield Aggregator</strong>, an omni-chain, multi-protocol yield optimization system live across multiple blockchains. Powered by a coordinated network of autonomous agents, the aggregator dynamically allocates capital in real time rather than relying on static strategies or manual rebalancing.</p>\n<p>As the agent factory expands, Maxshot is designed to support new on-chain use cases beyond yield optimization, while maintaining strict alignment with protocol risk frameworks and ecosystem incentives.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>5. Technical Architecture</h2>\n<p>Maxshot follows a protocol-agnostic, modular architecture optimized for transparency, security, and auditability. The system consists of three distinct layers:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Strategy Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Defines optimization logic and allocation objectives by analyzing real-time market data across Aave and other protocols. It generates allocation recommendations but has no execution authority.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-risk-layer-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-risk-layer-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Acts as the system\u2019s safety guardrail, enforcing predefined constraints such as protocol, asset, and chain exposure limits. Any action that violates these rules is automatically blocked and logged for transparency.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-execution-layer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-execution-layer-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Execution Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Handles all on-chain operations, including deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing. Execution is deterministic and fully auditable, and only proceeds after Risk Layer approval.</p>\n<p>This three-layer architecture ensures that strategy optimization, risk management, and execution transparency are never compromised. Each layer operates independently, and no single layer has authority over the entire system. This design reduces the risk of catastrophic failures and ensures that the Aave community retains full visibility and control over Maxshot\u2019s operations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>6. Rationale &amp; Differentiation</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI-native, automation-native financial infrastructure designed to manage and optimize on-chain financial activities.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional yield aggregators that rely on static strategies or manual rebalancing, Maxshot operates as a network of non-discretionary, autonomous agents that continuously evaluate market conditions and execute allocation decisions in real time, strictly within predefined risk constraints and governance-aligned parameters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-core-advantages-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-core-advantages-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Core Advantages</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Omni-chain, Multi-protocol Optimization</strong></p>\n<p>Capital is optimized globally across chains and protocols rather than siloed within a single deployment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Agent-driven (Non-discretionary) Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Deterministic agents execute strategies continuously without human intervention or discretionary decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Strategy, Risk, and Execution</strong></p>\n<p>A modular architecture enforces clear boundaries between optimization logic, risk controls, and execution, enhancing security, transparency, and independent auditability.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This architecture allows Maxshot to function not merely as a yield aggregator, but as a general-purpose AI agent platform, where additional agents (such as risk agents, liquidity routing agents, governance-aware execution agents, and protocol-specific strategy agents) can be composed and deployed over time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>7. Live Deployments &amp; Metrics</h2>\n<p>Maxshot has been live in production since December 2025, and has already attracted meaningful TVL, demonstrating operational readiness and early market validation.</p>\n<p>The platform currently manages approximately $9.8M in total TVL across live deployments, including ~$1.8M in the Omni USDC vault.

Summary</h2>\n<p>This proposal introduces <strong>Maxshot AI</strong> to the Aave community as a complementary, value-accretive yield optimization and distribution layer.</p>\n<p>As Maxshot is already integrated with Aave V3 markets across multiple chains, this proposal does <strong>not</strong> request any protocol parameter changes, risk parameter updates, or direct integrations. Instead, it seeks community awareness, feedback, and formal ecosystem recognition of Maxshot as a third-party strategy operator that enhances capital efficiency and user experience for Aave.</p>\n<p>By leveraging AI-driven, non-discretionary agents, Maxshot simplifies access to optimized, omni-chain yield opportunities, with the goal of increasing total value locked (TVL), capital efficiency, and liquidity stickiness across Aave markets.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2. Abstract</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI operates as an intelligent yield optimization layer built on top of Aave and other DeFi protocols. It automatically routes and rebalances capital across chains and markets using deterministic, AI-driven agents to maximize risk-adjusted returns.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to align the Aave community with an existing ecosystem partner that already contributes capital flows into Aave liquidity pools and improves user access to yield opportunities without introducing additional protocol risk.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3. Motivation</h2>\n<p>Aave is a foundational DeFi liquidity protocol with robust risk management, transparent governance, and deployments across multiple networks. While its multi-chain expansion is a core strength, it also introduces structural inefficiencies that create opportunities for complementary, user-layer optimization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-challenges-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-challenges-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Key Challenges</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Fragmentation:</strong> Liquidity is distributed across multiple Aave deployments, requiring users to manually bridge assets, compare rates, and manage positions across chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> Actively managing positions across multiple markets and networks is time-intensive and costly, leading to suboptimal capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Uneven Utilization:</strong> Friction at the user layer can result in idle liquidity and inconsistent utilization across Aave markets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Maxshot\u2019s Role</h3>\n<p>Maxshot AI acts as a non-custodial, intelligent routing and optimization layer on top of Aave, improving capital efficiency and user experience through automated, rules-based yield optimization\u2014without modifying or competing with Aave\u2019s core protocol.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4. Specification: Maxshot Overview</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI Agent Factory, an AI-native, automation-first infrastructure layer designed to build, deploy, and coordinate autonomous agents for on-chain capital optimization.</p>\n<p>At its core, Maxshot provides a standardized framework for creating protocol-aware, risk-constrained AI agents that can observe market conditions, reason over strategy sets, and execute actions across DeFi systems. These agents operate continuously within predefined risk models and governance-aligned parameters, enabling scalable and transparent automation at the infrastructure level.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Key Characteristics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deterministic, Continuous Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Agents operate autonomously and continuously, responding to market changes without manual intervention. All decisions follow transparent, rules-based logic that is auditable and verifiable on-chain, eliminating discretionary risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Full On-Chain Transparency</strong></p>\n<p>Every allocation, rebalance, and performance metric is recorded on-chain and available for real-time community review, enabling ongoing verification of compliance and protocol impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Maxshot enforces a strict separation between optimization logic (Strategy Layer), safety constraints (Risk Layer), and on-chain interactions (Execution Layer). This design ensures that strategy decisions cannot bypass risk controls and that all actions remain auditable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first flagship product built on this framework is <strong>Maxshot Omni Yield Aggregator</strong>, an omni-chain, multi-protocol yield optimization system live across multiple blockchains. Powered by a coordinated network of autonomous agents, the aggregator dynamically allocates capital in real time rather than relying on static strategies or manual rebalancing.</p>\n<p>As the agent factory expands, Maxshot is designed to support new on-chain use cases beyond yield optimization, while maintaining strict alignment with protocol risk frameworks and ecosystem incentives.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>5. Technical Architecture</h2>\n<p>Maxshot follows a protocol-agnostic, modular architecture optimized for transparency, security, and auditability. The system consists of three distinct layers:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Strategy Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Defines optimization logic and allocation objectives by analyzing real-time market data across Aave and other protocols. It generates allocation recommendations but has no execution authority.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-risk-layer-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-risk-layer-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Acts as the system\u2019s safety guardrail, enforcing predefined constraints such as protocol, asset, and chain exposure limits. Any action that violates these rules is automatically blocked and logged for transparency.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-execution-layer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-execution-layer-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Execution Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Handles all on-chain operations, including deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing. Execution is deterministic and fully auditable, and only proceeds after Risk Layer approval.</p>\n<p>This three-layer architecture ensures that strategy optimization, risk management, and execution transparency are never compromised. Each layer operates independently, and no single layer has authority over the entire system. This design reduces the risk of catastrophic failures and ensures that the Aave community retains full visibility and control over Maxshot\u2019s operations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>6. Rationale &amp; Differentiation</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI-native, automation-native financial infrastructure designed to manage and optimize on-chain financial activities.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional yield aggregators that rely on static strategies or manual rebalancing, Maxshot operates as a network of non-discretionary, autonomous agents that continuously evaluate market conditions and execute allocation decisions in real time, strictly within predefined risk constraints and governance-aligned parameters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-core-advantages-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-core-advantages-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Core Advantages</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Omni-chain, Multi-protocol Optimization</strong></p>\n<p>Capital is optimized globally across chains and protocols rather than siloed within a single deployment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Agent-driven (Non-discretionary) Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Deterministic agents execute strategies continuously without human intervention or discretionary decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Strategy, Risk, and Execution</strong></p>\n<p>A modular architecture enforces clear boundaries between optimization logic, risk controls, and execution, enhancing security, transparency, and independent auditability.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This architecture allows Maxshot to function not merely as a yield aggregator, but as a general-purpose AI agent platform, where additional agents (such as risk agents, liquidity routing agents, governance-aware execution agents, and protocol-specific strategy agents) can be composed and deployed over time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>7. Live Deployments &amp; Metrics</h2>\n<p>Maxshot has been live in production since December 2025, and has already attracted meaningful TVL, demonstrating operational readiness and early market validation.</p>\n<p>The platform currently manages approximately $9.8M in total TVL across live deployments, including ~$1.8M in the Omni USDC vault.

Abstract</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI operates as an intelligent yield optimization layer built on top of Aave and other DeFi protocols. It automatically routes and rebalances capital across chains and markets using deterministic, AI-driven agents to maximize risk-adjusted returns.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to align the Aave community with an existing ecosystem partner that already contributes capital flows into Aave liquidity pools and improves user access to yield opportunities without introducing additional protocol risk.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3. Motivation</h2>\n<p>Aave is a foundational DeFi liquidity protocol with robust risk management, transparent governance, and deployments across multiple networks. While its multi-chain expansion is a core strength, it also introduces structural inefficiencies that create opportunities for complementary, user-layer optimization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-challenges-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-challenges-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Key Challenges</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Fragmentation:</strong> Liquidity is distributed across multiple Aave deployments, requiring users to manually bridge assets, compare rates, and manage positions across chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> Actively managing positions across multiple markets and networks is time-intensive and costly, leading to suboptimal capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Uneven Utilization:</strong> Friction at the user layer can result in idle liquidity and inconsistent utilization across Aave markets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Maxshot\u2019s Role</h3>\n<p>Maxshot AI acts as a non-custodial, intelligent routing and optimization layer on top of Aave, improving capital efficiency and user experience through automated, rules-based yield optimization\u2014without modifying or competing with Aave\u2019s core protocol.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4. Specification: Maxshot Overview</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI Agent Factory, an AI-native, automation-first infrastructure layer designed to build, deploy, and coordinate autonomous agents for on-chain capital optimization.</p>\n<p>At its core, Maxshot provides a standardized framework for creating protocol-aware, risk-constrained AI agents that can observe market conditions, reason over strategy sets, and execute actions across DeFi systems. These agents operate continuously within predefined risk models and governance-aligned parameters, enabling scalable and transparent automation at the infrastructure level.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Key Characteristics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deterministic, Continuous Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Agents operate autonomously and continuously, responding to market changes without manual intervention. All decisions follow transparent, rules-based logic that is auditable and verifiable on-chain, eliminating discretionary risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Full On-Chain Transparency</strong></p>\n<p>Every allocation, rebalance, and performance metric is recorded on-chain and available for real-time community review, enabling ongoing verification of compliance and protocol impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Maxshot enforces a strict separation between optimization logic (Strategy Layer), safety constraints (Risk Layer), and on-chain interactions (Execution Layer). This design ensures that strategy decisions cannot bypass risk controls and that all actions remain auditable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first flagship product built on this framework is <strong>Maxshot Omni Yield Aggregator</strong>, an omni-chain, multi-protocol yield optimization system live across multiple blockchains. Powered by a coordinated network of autonomous agents, the aggregator dynamically allocates capital in real time rather than relying on static strategies or manual rebalancing.</p>\n<p>As the agent factory expands, Maxshot is designed to support new on-chain use cases beyond yield optimization, while maintaining strict alignment with protocol risk frameworks and ecosystem incentives.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>5. Technical Architecture</h2>\n<p>Maxshot follows a protocol-agnostic, modular architecture optimized for transparency, security, and auditability. The system consists of three distinct layers:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Strategy Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Defines optimization logic and allocation objectives by analyzing real-time market data across Aave and other protocols. It generates allocation recommendations but has no execution authority.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-risk-layer-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-risk-layer-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Acts as the system\u2019s safety guardrail, enforcing predefined constraints such as protocol, asset, and chain exposure limits. Any action that violates these rules is automatically blocked and logged for transparency.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-execution-layer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-execution-layer-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Execution Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Handles all on-chain operations, including deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing. Execution is deterministic and fully auditable, and only proceeds after Risk Layer approval.</p>\n<p>This three-layer architecture ensures that strategy optimization, risk management, and execution transparency are never compromised. Each layer operates independently, and no single layer has authority over the entire system. This design reduces the risk of catastrophic failures and ensures that the Aave community retains full visibility and control over Maxshot\u2019s operations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>6. Rationale &amp; Differentiation</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI-native, automation-native financial infrastructure designed to manage and optimize on-chain financial activities.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional yield aggregators that rely on static strategies or manual rebalancing, Maxshot operates as a network of non-discretionary, autonomous agents that continuously evaluate market conditions and execute allocation decisions in real time, strictly within predefined risk constraints and governance-aligned parameters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-core-advantages-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-core-advantages-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Core Advantages</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Omni-chain, Multi-protocol Optimization</strong></p>\n<p>Capital is optimized globally across chains and protocols rather than siloed within a single deployment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Agent-driven (Non-discretionary) Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Deterministic agents execute strategies continuously without human intervention or discretionary decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Strategy, Risk, and Execution</strong></p>\n<p>A modular architecture enforces clear boundaries between optimization logic, risk controls, and execution, enhancing security, transparency, and independent auditability.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This architecture allows Maxshot to function not merely as a yield aggregator, but as a general-purpose AI agent platform, where additional agents (such as risk agents, liquidity routing agents, governance-aware execution agents, and protocol-specific strategy agents) can be composed and deployed over time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>7. Live Deployments &amp; Metrics</h2>\n<p>Maxshot has been live in production since December 2025, and has already attracted meaningful TVL, demonstrating operational readiness and early market validation.</p>\n<p>The platform currently manages approximately $9.8M in total TVL across live deployments, including ~$1.8M in the Omni USDC vault. All deployments are fully on-chain and publicly verifiable, reducing the governance and execution risk typically associated with new strategy operators.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Strategy</th>\n<th>Asset</th>\n<th>Supported Chains</th>\n<th>TVL</th>\n<th>Status</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Maxshot Omni USDC</td>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism</td>\n<td>$1.82M</td>\n<td>Live</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Maxshot Omni USDT0</td>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>Launching this month</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Real-time performance and allocation data are available on the Maxshot dashboard:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://app.maxshot.ai/#\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">https://app.maxshot.ai/#</a></p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-8-performance-observations-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-8-performance-observations-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>8. Performance Observations</h2>\n<p>Maxshot omni-chain vaults prioritize stable, risk-adjusted returns rather than short-term yield maximization.</p>\n<p>The Maxshot Omni USDC vault has historically delivered APYs ranging between approximately 2% and 10% over the past month, with a recent 24-hour APY of 7.76%. Performance data is fully transparent and available in real time via the Maxshot application.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Period</th>\n<th>APY</th>\n<th>Volatility</th>\n<th>Max Drawdown</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1 Day</td>\n<td>7.76%</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>0.00%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7 Day (Est.)</td>\n<td>6.82%</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>0.15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14 Day (Est.)</td>\n<td>6.25%</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>0.25%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>21 Day (Est.)</td>\n<td>6.10%</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>0.35%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 Day (Est.)</td>\n<td>5.07%</td>\n<td>Low</td>\n<td>0.50%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p><strong>Key Observation:</strong></p>\n<p>Maxshot delivers stable, risk-adjusted returns rather than volatile peak yields. The ~5.07% 30-day average APY reflects a sustainable return after accounting for market volatility and rebalancing costs, while low drawdowns indicate effective risk management and controlled concentration.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-9-operational-readiness-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-9-operational-readiness-16\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>9.

It automatically routes and rebalances capital across chains and markets using deterministic, AI-driven agents to maximize risk-adjusted returns.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to align the Aave community with an existing ecosystem partner that already contributes capital flows into Aave liquidity pools and improves user access to yield opportunities without introducing additional protocol risk.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3. Motivation</h2>\n<p>Aave is a foundational DeFi liquidity protocol with robust risk management, transparent governance, and deployments across multiple networks. While its multi-chain expansion is a core strength, it also introduces structural inefficiencies that create opportunities for complementary, user-layer optimization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-challenges-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-challenges-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Key Challenges</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Fragmentation:</strong> Liquidity is distributed across multiple Aave deployments, requiring users to manually bridge assets, compare rates, and manage positions across chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> Actively managing positions across multiple markets and networks is time-intensive and costly, leading to suboptimal capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Uneven Utilization:</strong> Friction at the user layer can result in idle liquidity and inconsistent utilization across Aave markets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Maxshot\u2019s Role</h3>\n<p>Maxshot AI acts as a non-custodial, intelligent routing and optimization layer on top of Aave, improving capital efficiency and user experience through automated, rules-based yield optimization\u2014without modifying or competing with Aave\u2019s core protocol.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4. Specification: Maxshot Overview</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI Agent Factory, an AI-native, automation-first infrastructure layer designed to build, deploy, and coordinate autonomous agents for on-chain capital optimization.</p>\n<p>At its core, Maxshot provides a standardized framework for creating protocol-aware, risk-constrained AI agents that can observe market conditions, reason over strategy sets, and execute actions across DeFi systems. These agents operate continuously within predefined risk models and governance-aligned parameters, enabling scalable and transparent automation at the infrastructure level.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Key Characteristics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deterministic, Continuous Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Agents operate autonomously and continuously, responding to market changes without manual intervention. All decisions follow transparent, rules-based logic that is auditable and verifiable on-chain, eliminating discretionary risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Full On-Chain Transparency</strong></p>\n<p>Every allocation, rebalance, and performance metric is recorded on-chain and available for real-time community review, enabling ongoing verification of compliance and protocol impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Maxshot enforces a strict separation between optimization logic (Strategy Layer), safety constraints (Risk Layer), and on-chain interactions (Execution Layer). This design ensures that strategy decisions cannot bypass risk controls and that all actions remain auditable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first flagship product built on this framework is <strong>Maxshot Omni Yield Aggregator</strong>, an omni-chain, multi-protocol yield optimization system live across multiple blockchains. Powered by a coordinated network of autonomous agents, the aggregator dynamically allocates capital in real time rather than relying on static strategies or manual rebalancing.</p>\n<p>As the agent factory expands, Maxshot is designed to support new on-chain use cases beyond yield optimization, while maintaining strict alignment with protocol risk frameworks and ecosystem incentives.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>5. Technical Architecture</h2>\n<p>Maxshot follows a protocol-agnostic, modular architecture optimized for transparency, security, and auditability. The system consists of three distinct layers:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Strategy Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Defines optimization logic and allocation objectives by analyzing real-time market data across Aave and other protocols. It generates allocation recommendations but has no execution authority.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-risk-layer-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-risk-layer-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Acts as the system\u2019s safety guardrail, enforcing predefined constraints such as protocol, asset, and chain exposure limits. Any action that violates these rules is automatically blocked and logged for transparency.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-execution-layer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-execution-layer-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Execution Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Handles all on-chain operations, including deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing. Execution is deterministic and fully auditable, and only proceeds after Risk Layer approval.</p>\n<p>This three-layer architecture ensures that strategy optimization, risk management, and execution transparency are never compromised. Each layer operates independently, and no single layer has authority over the entire system. This design reduces the risk of catastrophic failures and ensures that the Aave community retains full visibility and control over Maxshot\u2019s operations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>6. Rationale &amp; Differentiation</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI-native, automation-native financial infrastructure designed to manage and optimize on-chain financial activities.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional yield aggregators that rely on static strategies or manual rebalancing, Maxshot operates as a network of non-discretionary, autonomous agents that continuously evaluate market conditions and execute allocation decisions in real time, strictly within predefined risk constraints and governance-aligned parameters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-core-advantages-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-core-advantages-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Core Advantages</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Omni-chain, Multi-protocol Optimization</strong></p>\n<p>Capital is optimized globally across chains and protocols rather than siloed within a single deployment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Agent-driven (Non-discretionary) Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Deterministic agents execute strategies continuously without human intervention or discretionary decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Strategy, Risk, and Execution</strong></p>\n<p>A modular architecture enforces clear boundaries between optimization logic, risk controls, and execution, enhancing security, transparency, and independent auditability.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This architecture allows Maxshot to function not merely as a yield aggregator, but as a general-purpose AI agent platform, where additional agents (such as risk agents, liquidity routing agents, governance-aware execution agents, and protocol-specific strategy agents) can be composed and deployed over time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>7. Live Deployments &amp; Metrics</h2>\n<p>Maxshot has been live in production since December 2025, and has already attracted meaningful TVL, demonstrating operational readiness and early market validation.</p>\n<p>The platform currently manages approximately $9.8M in total TVL across live deployments, including ~$1.8M in the Omni USDC vault.

The AIP was prompted by significant intraday price volatility in USDtb, which traded as low as $0.97 and as high as $1.01 within a single day. While these secondary-market prices largely reflected order flow and liquidity conditions, oracle price updates introduced material protocol risk, as borrowed USDtb positions temporarily increased in value, triggering liquidations.</p>\n<p>To mitigate the risk of similar events in the future, the proposal introduces a pricing mechanism that anchors USDtb debt to USD. However, until this oracle configuration is fully implemented, Chaos Labs recommends contracting both the supply and borrow caps of USDtb. This interim measure limits aggregate user exposure to USDtb debt and constrains potential risk. Specifically, we recommend setting the supply cap of USDtb to 200 million tokens and the borrow cap to 70 million.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61269-gho-usdc-base-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61269-gho-usdc-base-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>GHO &amp; USDC (Base)</h3>\n<p>The GHO and USDC on the Base instance have operated under an incentive-driven regime since the launch of the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-base-incentive-campaign-funding/21983\">Base Incentive Campaign</a>, which introduced borrow-side rewards for both stablecoins to accelerate early adoption and boost borrowing demand. During this period, interest rate parameters were intentionally tuned to accommodate discounted borrowing costs. The incentive campaign was explicitly designed as a temporary measure, with a six-month duration. As the campaign concludes, the Base markets are transitioning from subsidized demand toward a more organic regime. This shift fundamentally changes the behavior of both borrowers and suppliers. Borrow demand that was previously supported by incentives is expected to decline under current costs.

The AIP was prompted by significant intraday price volatility in USDtb, which traded as low as $0.97 and as high as $1.01 within a single day. While these secondary-market prices largely reflected order flow and liquidity conditions, oracle price updates introduced material protocol risk, as borrowed USDtb positions temporarily increased in value, triggering liquidations.</p>\n<p>To mitigate the risk of similar events in the future, the proposal introduces a pricing mechanism that anchors USDtb debt to USD. However, until this oracle configuration is fully implemented, Chaos Labs recommends contracting both the supply and borrow caps of USDtb. This interim measure limits aggregate user exposure to USDtb debt and constrains potential risk. Specifically, we recommend setting the supply cap of USDtb to 200 million tokens and the borrow cap to 70 million.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61269-gho-usdc-base-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61269-gho-usdc-base-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>GHO &amp; USDC (Base)</h3>\n<p>The GHO and USDC on the Base instance have operated under an incentive-driven regime since the launch of the <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-base-incentive-campaign-funding/21983\">Base Incentive Campaign</a>, which introduced borrow-side rewards for both stablecoins to accelerate early adoption and boost borrowing demand. During this period, interest rate parameters were intentionally tuned to accommodate discounted borrowing costs. The incentive campaign was explicitly designed as a temporary measure, with a six-month duration. As the campaign concludes, the Base markets are transitioning from subsidized demand toward a more organic regime. This shift fundamentally changes the behavior of both borrowers and suppliers. Borrow demand that was previously supported by incentives is expected to decline under current costs. Without an adjustment of the interest rate parameters, the conclusion of incentives risks compressing the utilization, reducing supplier participation, and increasing the likelihood of liquidity migration.</p>\n<p>Chaos Labs recommends targeting borrow rates of 5% and 5.5% for USDC and GHO on Base. This target is consistent with the prevailing target borrow rates for major stablecoins such as USDC and USDT on the Ethereum Core instance. Anchoring Base stablecoin markets to this level helps ensure continuity, reduces the risk of demand imbalances, and supports long-term Base instance market health.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61269-pt-usde-5feb2026-ethereum-core-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61269-pt-usde-5feb2026-ethereum-core-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>PT-USDe-5FEB2026 (Ethereum Core)</h3>\n<p>PT-USDe-5FEB2026 has reached its supply cap at 240 million tokens following an inflow of approximately 40 million since the 21st of January, indicating elevated demand to loop the asset on the Ethereum Core instance.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/de8a425ac5c4140f30b1aa9316ef34f9e0806118.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vKGdtHxNvfSOiTu6mltol2aF0Io.png?dl=1\" title=\"image (2)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/d/de8a425ac5c4140f30b1aa9316ef34f9e0806118_2_2000x209.png\" alt=\"image (2)\" data-base62-sha1=\"vKGdtHxNvfSOiTu6mltol2aF0Io\" width=\"2000\" height=\"209\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/d/de8a425ac5c4140f30b1aa9316ef34f9e0806118_2_2000x209.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/de8a425ac5c4140f30b1aa9316ef34f9e0806118.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/de8a425ac5c4140f30b1aa9316ef34f9e0806118.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"111725\"></a></div><br>\n<div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/76d218e44291b13a4663f956674c02d4a9e71155.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/gX8tjhCCgDs3F746CikRIlujojP.png?dl=1\" title=\"image (3)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/7/76d218e44291b13a4663f956674c02d4a9e71155.png\" alt=\"image (3)\" data-base62-sha1=\"gX8tjhCCgDs3F746CikRIlujojP\" width=\"1994\" height=\"678\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61269-supply-distribution-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61269-supply-distribution-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Supply Distribution</h3>\n<p>The supply of PT-USDe-5FEB2026 is highly concentrated as the market effectively consists of four positions.

real-world businesses</strong> via BizMarket, generating sustainable yield while onboarding new real economic actors into the Aave ecosystem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I built BizMarket to <strong>tokenize real, operating businesses as RWAs</strong>, enabling them to access onchain capital for growth and become yield generators for onchain users.</p>\n<p>These businesses already exist, generate revenue, and pay fees to be listed and attested onchain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This proposal requests $100,000 USDC from Aave DAO for a 4-month pilot deploying capital into tokenized real-world micro-businesses via BizMarket, targeting 4% net yield in 4 Months, while onboarding 500 emerging market businesses to the Aave ecosystem.</p>\n<p>TLDR;<br>\n<strong><a

flows</li>\n<li>Need predictable, non-extractive capital</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I built BizMarket to bridge this gap.</p>\n<p>We work directly with <strong>micro and small businesses</strong> (currently in

real-world businesses</strong> via BizMarket, generating sustainable yield while onboarding new real economic actors into the Aave ecosystem.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I built BizMarket to <strong>tokenize real, operating businesses as RWAs</strong>, enabling them to access onchain capital for growth and become yield generators for onchain users.</p>\n<p>These businesses already exist, generate revenue, and pay fees to be listed and attested onchain.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This proposal requests $100,000 USDC from Aave DAO for a 4-month pilot deploying capital into tokenized real-world micro-businesses via BizMarket, targeting 4% net yield in 4 Months, while onboarding 500 emerging market businesses to the Aave ecosystem.</p>\n<p>TLDR;<br>\n<strong><a
