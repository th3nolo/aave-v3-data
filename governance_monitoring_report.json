From the Reserve, GHO is distributed through independent channels, each with its own governance-controlled add cap, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lending Credit Lines</strong> to Prime, Aave-aligned Hub, Ethena, EtherFi, and Neobank Hubs, making GHO available for borrowing within each Hub\u2019s Spokes.</li>\n<li><strong>stataUSDC GSM</strong> and <strong>stataUSDT GSM</strong> for peg stability through direct swap mechanisms that are separate from the liquidity markets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each channel operates independently, so governance can scale GHO supply into high-demand Hubs while keeping tighter limits on newer environments without one affecting the capacity of another.</p>\n<p>Gho Stewards interact exclusively via the Credit Line funded by the Gho Reserve, with the Add Cap acting as the primary constraint on GHO expansion. This mirrors the economic role of the Gho Facilitator in Aave v3, where capacity is managed at the reserve level while the Add Cap replaces the Borrow Cap as the control on total GHO exposure. Governance and Gho Stewards retain direct authority over system growth through Credit Line adjustments.</p>\n<p>With each channel having its own cap and operating in a distinct market environment, governance can also <strong>choose precisely which collateral/risk profiles support incremental GHO supply</strong> (i.e., the <em>asset exposure</em> the protocol takes). This allows Aave to scale GHO where the underlying collateral and liquidation conditions are most trusted, while limiting exposure to newer or riskier setups.</p>\n<p>Separating stablecoin liquidity across distinct capped channels provides granular control over liquidity composition, liquidation behaviour, and surplus generation, while isolating each Spoke from broader Core market risk, allowing the Core market to provide a secondary-market savings option that complements sGHO, which has a suitably lower risk profile.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-prime-hub-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-prime-hub-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Concept - Prime Hub</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d222a41eeb7a9d743aa5570eacdd2a3dfdea61ff.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/tYWuc2bKw4Bly4HPRPigyfXmzjV.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d222a41eeb7a9d743aa5570eacdd2a3dfdea61ff.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"tYWuc2bKw4Bly4HPRPigyfXmzjV\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The Prime Hub best represents a more Senior market, characterised by isolated lending pools with tighter risk controls. Whilst a simple, isolated market structure can be created, the example above highlights how the Reinvestment feature could provide a distinct advantage relative to other markets. There are a few options for allocating the excess capital; one possibility is Simple Earn on Coinbase, or, to minimise counterparty risk, an allocation to a suitably low-risk Hub-and-Spoke, such as the Coinbase Hub-and-Spoke shown later. Creating such a market in which the supply yield always exceeds that of T-bills would be a welcome improvement relative to the current market, where supply rates are well below T-bill yields. The intention for this market is to limit collateral types to those with the lowest complexity, such as fiat-redeemable stablecoins and the most dominant BTC wrapper products.</p>\n<p>The graphic shows Lido\u2019s wstETH, the most dominant Liquid Staking Token (LST) with widespread adoption, as yield-generating collateral with the Max. Lido Yield Spoke is configured to support leverage yield strategies such as the stVault product. By isolating LST and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT) across the Hubs-and-Spoke, for example, Core and Prime, the market can price the risk associated with each collateral type. This also allows the cost of borrowing ETH to be market-determined without the need for directional/opinionated use of the Risk Premium between LRT and LSTs.</p>\n<p>Note: Lido\u2019s wstETH is used as an example, and other suitable LSTs may be included.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-core-hub-with-a-reinvestment-feature-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-core-hub-with-a-reinvestment-feature-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Concept - Core Hub with a Reinvestment Feature</strong></h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a94a9634794a5ce5bb0abce21b3e620f71b3a6a5.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/o9CuCnAbTv2mAnFGQstud52mIg5.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a94a9634794a5ce5bb0abce21b3e620f71b3a6a5.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"o9CuCnAbTv2mAnFGQstud52mIg5\" width=\"1647\" height=\"1400\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The Core market presented above is risk-adjusted and favours yield-generating collateral types, capital efficiency, and the creation of passive yield for the user, most similar to the existing Core market on Ethereum, with specialised Spokes, Draw Caps, and Add Caps used to limit asset exposure.</p>\n<p>Aave v4 expands the DAO\u2019s ability to express liquidity and risk policy at the system level, rather than having outcomes emerge solely as a by-product of utilisation dynamics. Idle stablecoin liquidity in the Core Hub is no longer structurally constrained to lower productivity; it can be allocated, within governance-defined bounds, into highly liquid, low-risk instruments, thereby establishing a baseline return profile for idle capital.</p>\n<p>This approach enhances capital efficiency without altering the protocol\u2019s liquidity assurances. By allowing a portion of idle capital to remain productive within governance-defined constraints, v4 supports a more stable return profile than prior versions, translating design flexibility into measured economic benefits at the protocol level.</p>\n<p><strong>Reinvestment Feature</strong></p>\n<p>Stablecoins sitting idle in the Core Hub (not currently borrowed by any Spoke) are put to work. A reinvestment controller routes them into yield strategies such as sUSDS to earn the Sky Savings Rate, Coinbase\u2019s Simple Earn, and potentially highly liquid RWAs. At scale, the reinvestment feature can behave like a portfolio to balance duration schedules and target a specific yield profile.</p>\n<p>The Core Hub also extends credit lines to other Hubs (Aave-aligned, EtherFi, Ethena). When borrowing demand increases, reinvested capital from yield strategies is immediately withdrawn and made available. The interest rate model accounts for the amount of reinvestment, so rates adjust accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks and considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Bad debt on any Spoke is shared across all Hub suppliers. Draw Caps are the primary safeguard, bounding maximum loss per Spoke. Reinvestment is only safe with instant-redeem strategies. If too much idle capital is reinvested and multiple Spokes spike utilisation simultaneously, there may not be enough instant liquidity to serve all withdrawals and borrows at once.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-neobank-configuration-etherfi-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-neobank-configuration-etherfi-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Concept  -  Neobank Configuration (EtherFi)</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d8011b62eaa286599e802f448ad19fb73b854881.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uORvkoIxpmR0ZeSw0tGQpofQT8B.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470875-y\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d8011b62eaa286599e802f448ad19fb73b854881.jpeg\" alt=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470875-y\" data-base62-sha1=\"uORvkoIxpmR0ZeSw0tGQpofQT8B\" width=\"1280\" height=\"704\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This configuration places a dedicated EtherFi Hub at the centre of a Neobank use case, in which users deposit weETH as collateral and borrow stablecoins that are loaded onto an EtherFi Pay card. weETH continues to earn restaking yield while serving as collateral, thereby allowing users maintain ETH exposure and staking returns while accessing stablecoin liquidity.</p>\n<p>Stablecoin liquidity enters the Hub through two paths. USDC and USDT are sourced from the Core Hub via a stablecoin credit line. GHO enters from the GHO Reserve through a GHO Credit Line with a defined Add Cap, acting as a backstop, ensuring the market remains funded even if the stablecoin credit line reaches its cap. Users interact with one of the EtherFi Pay Spokes, which handles collateral, borrowing, and position tracking, and draws stablecoins from the Hub via a Stablecoins Draw Cap.</p>\n<p>Borrowers who draw GHO can route it through the Gho Stability Module to receive either USDC or USDT, enabling fiat conversion and supporting any payment card. GHO\u2019s borrowing rate is also likely to be less volatile due to the inherently flatter utilisation curve and can be customised through governance to support specific partnership arrangements.</p>\n<p>Whilst this Hub would likely be a net receiver of stablecoins from the Core Hub via the credit line, any idle USDC or EURC could be routed to Coinbase\u2019s Simple Earn product, acting as a low-risk staking option. The yield could be either directed to attract new deposits, routed to Aave DAO to enhance revenue generation, or used to reduce the EtherFi Foundation\u2019s opportunity cost of providing capital to the market.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks and Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Collateral is concentrated in a single asset, weETH or eBTC, in a single collateral-spoke configuration. Any de-pegging or slashing event would affect all positions in the absence of a diversification buffer. Stablecoin availability depends on Core Hub credit line and GHO Reserve caps, both governance-controlled. If both reach their limits during periods of high demand, borrowing may be temporarily constrained, though this is partially mitigated by the GHO Stewards, who can mint and deposit additional GHO on short notice.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-centralised-exchange-hub-coinbase-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-centralised-exchange-hub-coinbase-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Concept - Centralised Exchange Hub (Coinbase)</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/8f43db96c3192fc6fa6c8cbed6934908081d94ad.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/krnF65u5RfBi5bIULjoBGvb9sYJ.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/8f43db96c3192fc6fa6c8cbed6934908081d94ad.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"krnF65u5RfBi5bIULjoBGvb9sYJ\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Three isolated Spokes each pair a single collateral asset (cbBTC, cbETH, wETH) against USDC as the sole borrowable asset. Isolating each collateral ensures that a value impairment of one asset does not affect positions backed by other collateral types at the Spoke level. USDC liquidity enters through a Prime Hub stablecoin credit line, reflecting the lower risk profile of this Hub-and-Spoke combination. Idle USDC is routed into Coinbase Simple Earn, the native yield strategy for the Coinbase/Circle ecosystem, though governance could configure any instant-redeem alternative.</p>\n<p>To ensure the On-chain Earn yield from Coinbase exceeds the passive Simple Earn yield, the reinvestment feature, in combination with some account mapping by Coinbase, could direct a portion of the Simple Earn yield to On-chain Earn users to amplify the capital efficiency of the system. Such a system can be implemented using the Centralised Exchanges API and would amplify the On-chain Earn user case whilst still enhancing Aave DAO\u2019s revenue relative to the case with no reinvestment feature.<br>\n<strong>Risks and Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>A Coinbase operational issue could impact both cbBTC and cbETH simultaneously, even though they sit in separate Spokes.

The Stablecoins Spoke allows assets to be allocated into a purpose-curved Ethena Hub as supply-only deposits. To reduce Ethena\u2019s concentration risk, a Credit Line is provided from the Core Hub and a GHO Credit Line is extended via the Gho Reserve as a backstop, such that Ethena can supply/withdraw from the stablecoin spoke with ease.</p>\n<p>The two isolated cbBTC and wETH spokes indicate how Ethena is currently allocating a portion of USDe\u2019s backing to lending protocols that utilise isolated market structures. Each spoke can access liquidity for USDT, pyUSD, USDC, and GHO via Draw Caps.</p>\n<p>The Borrow Rate, set at the Hub, can be configured with a Steward/Risk Oracle to ensure that the Borrow Rate is relative to the Reinvestment feature rate of return, thereby ensuring that any assets backing USDe generate at least a specified ratio of the Reinvestment feature\u2019s returns.</p>\n<p>In this example, we use the Sky Savings Rate (SSR) for reference only. The market has a borrow rate linked to sUSDS and a premium equal to the Aave Fee. This is similar to how Spark deployed USDS to the Aave Prime instance, where the Borrow Rate was a function of the SSR plus a premium because it was not the Spark Protocol itself.</p>\n<p>Linking the Borrow Rate to the Reinvestment feature ensures that Ethena always earns at least the SSR. However, any asset with suitable liquidity could be used, such as a T+1 RWA earning over 5%, with additional considerations needed for managing the liquidity requirement. The larger GHO becomes, the easier it will be for GHO to facilitate providing the liquidity needed to ensure the market is always well capitalised. The user would need to migrate debt from another asset to GHO; however, this would be routed via the GSM to ensure a seamless user experience.</p>\n<p>In this market configuration, we demonstrate that the yield from the Reinvestment feature enhances returns on the assets backing USDe relative to actively allocating directly to the strategy or to a lending protocol, which has no floor yield (i.e., no reinvestment feature). Aave\u2019s revenue would be derived from the Reserve Factor on the debt, which would be expressed as a premium relative to the selected investment strategy if all the yield is directed to Ethena.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks and Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Backing assets serve dual roles as USDe redemption capital and Aave liquidity. During a contraction, mass redemptions may prompt withdrawals from the Hub as borrowing demand shifts. Bad debt on either Spoke is shared across all Hub suppliers, including Ethena\u2019s own deposits.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-aave-aligned-hub-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-aave-aligned-hub-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Concept - Aave-aligned Hub</strong></h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/2d8d419152eabd6f9b9302174b072378e88584e5.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/6uY7OpYCQU94eDAzaMmrlOwMqXP.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470891-y\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/2d8d419152eabd6f9b9302174b072378e88584e5.jpeg\" alt=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470891-y\" data-base62-sha1=\"6uY7OpYCQU94eDAzaMmrlOwMqXP\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This configuration establishes a dedicated Aave Aligned Hub containing two isolated Spokes, designed for borrowers who utilise protocol-aligned assets as collateral to access stablecoin liquidity. The Aave Spoke supports directly aligned collateral (stkAAVE, AAVE), while the Chianlink Spoke supports indirectly aligned collateral (LINK). Collateral across both Spokes is not rehypothecated and remains continuously available for withdrawal and liquidation, ensuring solvency restoration depends solely on spoke-level liquidation mechanics and enabling controlled tuning of risk and execution outcomes.</p>\n<p>Both Spokes support borrowing USDC and USDT from the Core Hub, alongside GHO introduced through a dedicated Gho Credit Line, each governed by an independent Add Cap. Whilst USDC and USDT provide diversity, the Gho Borrow Rate can be configured at a lower rate than that of other hubs to recognise stkAAVE and AAVE holders as part of a broader tokenomics benefits package.</p>\n<p>Given the borrower-aligned design of this Hub, a borrower-UX\u2013oriented liquidation configuration, featuring smaller liquidations and lower liquidation bonuses, should be considered across both Spokes. This approach minimises borrower disruption, reduces collateral loss, and maintains predictable liquidation behaviour, aligning with the Hub\u2019s objective of supporting protocol-aligned participants while preserving strong capital backing and controlled risk.</p>\n<p>While the collateral sets are subject to asset volatility, both Spokes intentionally bias slightly toward borrower UX relative to what volatility alone might suggest. This is enabled by strict isolation from the Core Hub, conservative add caps, and spoke-level risk containment, which together allow for a more gradual liquidation profile without materially increasing bad debt risk. In stressed scenarios, faster execution parameters remain available as a governance-controlled adjustment, allowing risk management to be tightened if market conditions warrant.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk and considerations</strong></p>\n<p>The Aave Spoke\u2019s collateral base is structurally correlated, as stkAAVE and AAVE are both closely linked to the Aave ecosystem and may be affected simultaneously by protocol-level events. The LINK Spoke introduces independent risk vectors LINK\u2019s value is driven by Chainlink network adoption and broader market conditions rather than Aave-specific dynamics. The two-spoke architecture ensures risk events in one Spoke do not propagate to the other. Risks across both Spokes are mitigated through conservative caps, spoke-level isolation, and governance-controlled parameters.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61584-conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-conclusion-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>This post outlines concepts of possible Hub-and-Spoke configurations enabled by V4. We covered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prime Hub:</strong> A lower risk, Senior market focusing on isolated use cases and offering controlled exposure to the most established multi-cycle assets, with a focus on fiat-backed stablecoins</li>\n<li><strong>Core Hub:</strong> Pools blue-chip collateral across multiple spokes, providing a risk-adjusted yield with elevated capital efficiency relative to v3 via the Reinvestment features.</li>\n<li><strong>Etherfi, Coinbase Hubs:</strong> Opinionated market participant hubs focused on specific use cases, optimised for each respective business\u2019s considerations</li>\n<li><strong>Ethena Hub:</strong>  A low-risk, isolated market structure could be positioned to generate a yield on assets that provide collateral backing for a stablecoin</li>\n<li><strong>Aave-Aligned Hub:</strong> Isolated Spokes for protocol-aligned assets like stkAAVE, AAVE, wstLINK &amp; LINK with preferential cost of capital alignment via a Gho Credit Line</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each design entails different trade-offs among capital efficiency, risk isolation, and liquidity depth.</p>\n<p>GHO is integral to every configuration as the backbone stablecoin across V4 markets. Each Hub draws GHO from the Reserve through independently capped Credit Lines, so governance controls exactly how much GHO enters each market and against what collateral. As these Hubs scale, GHO scales with them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that none of these are final recommendations. Risk parameterisation and asset listing decisions are controlled by AAVE token holders and elected Stewards, typically specialists, to facilitate operational implementation.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61584-disclaimer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-disclaimer-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclaimer</h1>\n<p>TokenLogic did not receive any payment for this post.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61584-copyright-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-copyright-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Copyright</h1>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived via <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CC0</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/hubs-spokes-in-aave-v4/24040\">Read full topic</a></p>\n          ",

Risk Premiums allow Spokes to price borrowing costs based on collateral quality; borrowers using riskier assets pay for the risk they introduce, rather than being subsidised by those posting ETH or BTC.

From the Reserve, GHO is distributed through independent channels, each with its own governance-controlled add cap, for example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lending Credit Lines</strong> to Prime, Aave-aligned Hub, Ethena, EtherFi, and Neobank Hubs, making GHO available for borrowing within each Hub\u2019s Spokes.</li>\n<li><strong>stataUSDC GSM</strong> and <strong>stataUSDT GSM</strong> for peg stability through direct swap mechanisms that are separate from the liquidity markets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each channel operates independently, so governance can scale GHO supply into high-demand Hubs while keeping tighter limits on newer environments without one affecting the capacity of another.</p>\n<p>Gho Stewards interact exclusively via the Credit Line funded by the Gho Reserve, with the Add Cap acting as the primary constraint on GHO expansion. This mirrors the economic role of the Gho Facilitator in Aave v3, where capacity is managed at the reserve level while the Add Cap replaces the Borrow Cap as the control on total GHO exposure. Governance and Gho Stewards retain direct authority over system growth through Credit Line adjustments.</p>\n<p>With each channel having its own cap and operating in a distinct market environment, governance can also <strong>choose precisely which collateral/risk profiles support incremental GHO supply</strong> (i.e., the <em>asset exposure</em> the protocol takes). This allows Aave to scale GHO where the underlying collateral and liquidation conditions are most trusted, while limiting exposure to newer or riskier setups.</p>\n<p>Separating stablecoin liquidity across distinct capped channels provides granular control over liquidity composition, liquidation behaviour, and surplus generation, while isolating each Spoke from broader Core market risk, allowing the Core market to provide a secondary-market savings option that complements sGHO, which has a suitably lower risk profile.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-prime-hub-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-prime-hub-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Concept - Prime Hub</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d222a41eeb7a9d743aa5570eacdd2a3dfdea61ff.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/tYWuc2bKw4Bly4HPRPigyfXmzjV.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d222a41eeb7a9d743aa5570eacdd2a3dfdea61ff.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"tYWuc2bKw4Bly4HPRPigyfXmzjV\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The Prime Hub best represents a more Senior market, characterised by isolated lending pools with tighter risk controls. Whilst a simple, isolated market structure can be created, the example above highlights how the Reinvestment feature could provide a distinct advantage relative to other markets. There are a few options for allocating the excess capital; one possibility is Simple Earn on Coinbase, or, to minimise counterparty risk, an allocation to a suitably low-risk Hub-and-Spoke, such as the Coinbase Hub-and-Spoke shown later. Creating such a market in which the supply yield always exceeds that of T-bills would be a welcome improvement relative to the current market, where supply rates are well below T-bill yields. The intention for this market is to limit collateral types to those with the lowest complexity, such as fiat-redeemable stablecoins and the most dominant BTC wrapper products.</p>\n<p>The graphic shows Lido\u2019s wstETH, the most dominant Liquid Staking Token (LST) with widespread adoption, as yield-generating collateral with the Max. Lido Yield Spoke is configured to support leverage yield strategies such as the stVault product. By isolating LST and Liquid Restaking Tokens (LRT) across the Hubs-and-Spoke, for example, Core and Prime, the market can price the risk associated with each collateral type. This also allows the cost of borrowing ETH to be market-determined without the need for directional/opinionated use of the Risk Premium between LRT and LSTs.</p>\n<p>Note: Lido\u2019s wstETH is used as an example, and other suitable LSTs may be included.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-core-hub-with-a-reinvestment-feature-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-core-hub-with-a-reinvestment-feature-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Concept - Core Hub with a Reinvestment Feature</strong></h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a94a9634794a5ce5bb0abce21b3e620f71b3a6a5.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/o9CuCnAbTv2mAnFGQstud52mIg5.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/a/a94a9634794a5ce5bb0abce21b3e620f71b3a6a5.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"o9CuCnAbTv2mAnFGQstud52mIg5\" width=\"1647\" height=\"1400\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The Core market presented above is risk-adjusted and favours yield-generating collateral types, capital efficiency, and the creation of passive yield for the user, most similar to the existing Core market on Ethereum, with specialised Spokes, Draw Caps, and Add Caps used to limit asset exposure.</p>\n<p>Aave v4 expands the DAO\u2019s ability to express liquidity and risk policy at the system level, rather than having outcomes emerge solely as a by-product of utilisation dynamics. Idle stablecoin liquidity in the Core Hub is no longer structurally constrained to lower productivity; it can be allocated, within governance-defined bounds, into highly liquid, low-risk instruments, thereby establishing a baseline return profile for idle capital.</p>\n<p>This approach enhances capital efficiency without altering the protocol\u2019s liquidity assurances. By allowing a portion of idle capital to remain productive within governance-defined constraints, v4 supports a more stable return profile than prior versions, translating design flexibility into measured economic benefits at the protocol level.</p>\n<p><strong>Reinvestment Feature</strong></p>\n<p>Stablecoins sitting idle in the Core Hub (not currently borrowed by any Spoke) are put to work. A reinvestment controller routes them into yield strategies such as sUSDS to earn the Sky Savings Rate, Coinbase\u2019s Simple Earn, and potentially highly liquid RWAs. At scale, the reinvestment feature can behave like a portfolio to balance duration schedules and target a specific yield profile.</p>\n<p>The Core Hub also extends credit lines to other Hubs (Aave-aligned, EtherFi, Ethena). When borrowing demand increases, reinvested capital from yield strategies is immediately withdrawn and made available. The interest rate model accounts for the amount of reinvestment, so rates adjust accordingly.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks and considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Bad debt on any Spoke is shared across all Hub suppliers. Draw Caps are the primary safeguard, bounding maximum loss per Spoke. Reinvestment is only safe with instant-redeem strategies. If too much idle capital is reinvested and multiple Spokes spike utilisation simultaneously, there may not be enough instant liquidity to serve all withdrawals and borrows at once.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-neobank-configuration-etherfi-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-neobank-configuration-etherfi-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Concept  -  Neobank Configuration (EtherFi)</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d8011b62eaa286599e802f448ad19fb73b854881.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uORvkoIxpmR0ZeSw0tGQpofQT8B.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470875-y\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d8011b62eaa286599e802f448ad19fb73b854881.jpeg\" alt=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470875-y\" data-base62-sha1=\"uORvkoIxpmR0ZeSw0tGQpofQT8B\" width=\"1280\" height=\"704\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This configuration places a dedicated EtherFi Hub at the centre of a Neobank use case, in which users deposit weETH as collateral and borrow stablecoins that are loaded onto an EtherFi Pay card. weETH continues to earn restaking yield while serving as collateral, thereby allowing users maintain ETH exposure and staking returns while accessing stablecoin liquidity.</p>\n<p>Stablecoin liquidity enters the Hub through two paths. USDC and USDT are sourced from the Core Hub via a stablecoin credit line. GHO enters from the GHO Reserve through a GHO Credit Line with a defined Add Cap, acting as a backstop, ensuring the market remains funded even if the stablecoin credit line reaches its cap. Users interact with one of the EtherFi Pay Spokes, which handles collateral, borrowing, and position tracking, and draws stablecoins from the Hub via a Stablecoins Draw Cap.</p>\n<p>Borrowers who draw GHO can route it through the Gho Stability Module to receive either USDC or USDT, enabling fiat conversion and supporting any payment card. GHO\u2019s borrowing rate is also likely to be less volatile due to the inherently flatter utilisation curve and can be customised through governance to support specific partnership arrangements.</p>\n<p>Whilst this Hub would likely be a net receiver of stablecoins from the Core Hub via the credit line, any idle USDC or EURC could be routed to Coinbase\u2019s Simple Earn product, acting as a low-risk staking option. The yield could be either directed to attract new deposits, routed to Aave DAO to enhance revenue generation, or used to reduce the EtherFi Foundation\u2019s opportunity cost of providing capital to the market.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks and Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Collateral is concentrated in a single asset, weETH or eBTC, in a single collateral-spoke configuration. Any de-pegging or slashing event would affect all positions in the absence of a diversification buffer. Stablecoin availability depends on Core Hub credit line and GHO Reserve caps, both governance-controlled. If both reach their limits during periods of high demand, borrowing may be temporarily constrained, though this is partially mitigated by the GHO Stewards, who can mint and deposit additional GHO on short notice.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-centralised-exchange-hub-coinbase-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-centralised-exchange-hub-coinbase-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Concept - Centralised Exchange Hub (Coinbase)</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/8f43db96c3192fc6fa6c8cbed6934908081d94ad.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/krnF65u5RfBi5bIULjoBGvb9sYJ.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/8f43db96c3192fc6fa6c8cbed6934908081d94ad.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"krnF65u5RfBi5bIULjoBGvb9sYJ\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>Three isolated Spokes each pair a single collateral asset (cbBTC, cbETH, wETH) against USDC as the sole borrowable asset.

USDC liquidity enters through a Prime Hub stablecoin credit line, reflecting the lower risk profile of this Hub-and-Spoke combination. Idle USDC is routed into Coinbase Simple Earn, the native yield strategy for the Coinbase/Circle ecosystem, though governance could configure any instant-redeem alternative.</p>\n<p>To ensure the On-chain Earn yield from Coinbase exceeds the passive Simple Earn yield, the reinvestment feature, in combination with some account mapping by Coinbase, could direct a portion of the Simple Earn yield to On-chain Earn users to amplify the capital efficiency of the system.

The Stablecoins Spoke allows assets to be allocated into a purpose-curved Ethena Hub as supply-only deposits. To reduce Ethena\u2019s concentration risk, a Credit Line is provided from the Core Hub and a GHO Credit Line is extended via the Gho Reserve as a backstop, such that Ethena can supply/withdraw from the stablecoin spoke with ease.</p>\n<p>The two isolated cbBTC and wETH spokes indicate how Ethena is currently allocating a portion of USDe\u2019s backing to lending protocols that utilise isolated market structures. Each spoke can access liquidity for USDT, pyUSD, USDC, and GHO via Draw Caps.</p>\n<p>The Borrow Rate, set at the Hub, can be configured with a Steward/Risk Oracle to ensure that the Borrow Rate is relative to the Reinvestment feature rate of return, thereby ensuring that any assets backing USDe generate at least a specified ratio of the Reinvestment feature\u2019s returns.</p>\n<p>In this example, we use the Sky Savings Rate (SSR) for reference only. The market has a borrow rate linked to sUSDS and a premium equal to the Aave Fee. This is similar to how Spark deployed USDS to the Aave Prime instance, where the Borrow Rate was a function of the SSR plus a premium because it was not the Spark Protocol itself.</p>\n<p>Linking the Borrow Rate to the Reinvestment feature ensures that Ethena always earns at least the SSR. However, any asset with suitable liquidity could be used, such as a T+1 RWA earning over 5%, with additional considerations needed for managing the liquidity requirement. The larger GHO becomes, the easier it will be for GHO to facilitate providing the liquidity needed to ensure the market is always well capitalised. The user would need to migrate debt from another asset to GHO; however, this would be routed via the GSM to ensure a seamless user experience.</p>\n<p>In this market configuration, we demonstrate that the yield from the Reinvestment feature enhances returns on the assets backing USDe relative to actively allocating directly to the strategy or to a lending protocol, which has no floor yield (i.e., no reinvestment feature). Aave\u2019s revenue would be derived from the Reserve Factor on the debt, which would be expressed as a premium relative to the selected investment strategy if all the yield is directed to Ethena.</p>\n<p><strong>Risks and Considerations</strong></p>\n<p>Backing assets serve dual roles as USDe redemption capital and Aave liquidity. During a contraction, mass redemptions may prompt withdrawals from the Hub as borrowing demand shifts. Bad debt on either Spoke is shared across all Hub suppliers, including Ethena\u2019s own deposits.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61584-concept-aave-aligned-hub-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-concept-aave-aligned-hub-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Concept - Aave-aligned Hub</strong></h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/2d8d419152eabd6f9b9302174b072378e88584e5.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/6uY7OpYCQU94eDAzaMmrlOwMqXP.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470891-y\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/2/2d8d419152eabd6f9b9302174b072378e88584e5.jpeg\" alt=\"telegram-cloud-photo-size-4-5791905828821470891-y\" data-base62-sha1=\"6uY7OpYCQU94eDAzaMmrlOwMqXP\" width=\"1280\" height=\"720\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This configuration establishes a dedicated Aave Aligned Hub containing two isolated Spokes, designed for borrowers who utilise protocol-aligned assets as collateral to access stablecoin liquidity. The Aave Spoke supports directly aligned collateral (stkAAVE, AAVE), while the Chianlink Spoke supports indirectly aligned collateral (LINK). Collateral across both Spokes is not rehypothecated and remains continuously available for withdrawal and liquidation, ensuring solvency restoration depends solely on spoke-level liquidation mechanics and enabling controlled tuning of risk and execution outcomes.</p>\n<p>Both Spokes support borrowing USDC and USDT from the Core Hub, alongside GHO introduced through a dedicated Gho Credit Line, each governed by an independent Add Cap. Whilst USDC and USDT provide diversity, the Gho Borrow Rate can be configured at a lower rate than that of other hubs to recognise stkAAVE and AAVE holders as part of a broader tokenomics benefits package.</p>\n<p>Given the borrower-aligned design of this Hub, a borrower-UX\u2013oriented liquidation configuration, featuring smaller liquidations and lower liquidation bonuses, should be considered across both Spokes. This approach minimises borrower disruption, reduces collateral loss, and maintains predictable liquidation behaviour, aligning with the Hub\u2019s objective of supporting protocol-aligned participants while preserving strong capital backing and controlled risk.</p>\n<p>While the collateral sets are subject to asset volatility, both Spokes intentionally bias slightly toward borrower UX relative to what volatility alone might suggest. This is enabled by strict isolation from the Core Hub, conservative add caps, and spoke-level risk containment, which together allow for a more gradual liquidation profile without materially increasing bad debt risk. In stressed scenarios, faster execution parameters remain available as a governance-controlled adjustment, allowing risk management to be tightened if market conditions warrant.</p>\n<p><strong>Risk and considerations</strong></p>\n<p>The Aave Spoke\u2019s collateral base is structurally correlated, as stkAAVE and AAVE are both closely linked to the Aave ecosystem and may be affected simultaneously by protocol-level events. The LINK Spoke introduces independent risk vectors LINK\u2019s value is driven by Chainlink network adoption and broader market conditions rather than Aave-specific dynamics. The two-spoke architecture ensures risk events in one Spoke do not propagate to the other. Risks across both Spokes are mitigated through conservative caps, spoke-level isolation, and governance-controlled parameters.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61584-conclusion-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-conclusion-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>This post outlines concepts of possible Hub-and-Spoke configurations enabled by V4. We covered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Prime Hub:</strong> A lower risk, Senior market focusing on isolated use cases and offering controlled exposure to the most established multi-cycle assets, with a focus on fiat-backed stablecoins</li>\n<li><strong>Core Hub:</strong> Pools blue-chip collateral across multiple spokes, providing a risk-adjusted yield with elevated capital efficiency relative to v3 via the Reinvestment features.</li>\n<li><strong>Etherfi, Coinbase Hubs:</strong> Opinionated market participant hubs focused on specific use cases, optimised for each respective business\u2019s considerations</li>\n<li><strong>Ethena Hub:</strong>  A low-risk, isolated market structure could be positioned to generate a yield on assets that provide collateral backing for a stablecoin</li>\n<li><strong>Aave-Aligned Hub:</strong> Isolated Spokes for protocol-aligned assets like stkAAVE, AAVE, wstLINK &amp; LINK with preferential cost of capital alignment via a Gho Credit Line</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each design entails different trade-offs among capital efficiency, risk isolation, and liquidity depth.</p>\n<p>GHO is integral to every configuration as the backbone stablecoin across V4 markets. Each Hub draws GHO from the Reserve through independently capped Credit Lines, so governance controls exactly how much GHO enters each market and against what collateral. As these Hubs scale, GHO scales with them.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to note that none of these are final recommendations. Risk parameterisation and asset listing decisions are controlled by AAVE token holders and elected Stewards, typically specialists, to facilitate operational implementation.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61584-disclaimer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-disclaimer-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclaimer</h1>\n<p>TokenLogic did not receive any payment for this post.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61584-copyright-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61584-copyright-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Copyright</h1>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived via <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CC0</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/hubs-spokes-in-aave-v4/24040\">Read full topic</a></p>\n          ",

The actual design has more layers. LRT holders borrow wstETH. wstETH holders borrow wETH. Demand builds across the entire stack instead of every LRT fighting over the same wETH pool. LRT borrowing pushes wstETH utilization up, so wstETH supply rates rise. Higher supply rates attract more wstETH deposits. More deposits deepen the wETH borrow pool. Each layer feeds the next, and both users and the DAO earn more at every step.

The LRT loop also drives stablecoin borrow demand not captured in the 48% floor, pushing the true figure higher.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61756-revenue-by-chain-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61756-revenue-by-chain-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Revenue by Chain</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/5a830a70ffc41ed4f688ec738d430935eb85adbd.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/cUHJ0tIJRoUqsB8RC3xXTq6f3fD.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Revenue by Chain\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/5a830a70ffc41ed4f688ec738d430935eb85adbd.jpeg\" alt=\"Revenue by Chain\" data-base62-sha1=\"cUHJ0tIJRoUqsB8RC3xXTq6f3fD\" width=\"1800\" height=\"996\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><em>Plasma\u2019s accelerating trajectory is detailed below.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61756-revenue-by-asset-2025-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61756-revenue-by-asset-2025-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Revenue by Asset (2025)</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/1a3c54c5e020eacd658c1120a13459758e8bb9d1.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3K5FJrvlYPpcaoaGqPDZ7ZxkLFn.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Revenue by Asset (2025)\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/1a3c54c5e020eacd658c1120a13459758e8bb9d1.jpeg\" alt=\"Revenue by Asset (2025)\" data-base62-sha1=\"3K5FJrvlYPpcaoaGqPDZ7ZxkLFn\" width=\"1800\" height=\"996\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><em>On-chain verification: V3 pool scan confirms WETH at $33.0M/yr at current rates (gap vs $37.0M = ETH price decline, not reduced activity; ETH-denominated borrowing grew +12%).</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61756-the-plasma-story-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61756-the-plasma-story-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>The Plasma Story</h3>\n<p>Plasma is the clearest single example.

What Would Aave Look Like Without ACI?</h2>\n<p>Fair question. Tokenholders should ask it about every service provider.</p>\n<p>Without us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No incentive management.</strong> $101M in campaigns (DAO + partner-funded) would not have been designed, deployed, or optimized. Every competitor runs their own incentive programs. Without ours, Aave\u2019s TVL growth stalls and competitors close the gap.</li>\n<li><strong>No LRT revenue engine.</strong> The recursive loop that generates $37M/yr does not get built. weETH does not get onboarded. Reserve Factors do not get optimized. WETH borrows stay at $1.1B instead of $5.87B.</li>\n<li><strong>No Ethena capture.</strong> At peak, $6.8B on Aave. Without us, that capital flows to Morpho, which generates zero protocol revenue from it.</li>\n<li><strong>No Skywards pipeline.</strong> Asset onboarding would rely on individual proposers navigating governance alone. RLUSD, EURC, USDe, and dozens of other assets would have been listed later or not at all.</li>\n<li><strong>No GHO growth engine.</strong> The sGHO framework, cross-chain expansion, and $12M in targeted incentives are our contribution to a joint effort with TokenLogic. Without our half, the growth engine stalls.</li>\n<li><strong>No MASIv partnerships.</strong> $80M in external partner funding does not flow into Aave without a team managing those relationships.</li>\n<li><strong>No governance throughput.</strong> 61% of all governance actions since ACI started (845 Snapshots and AIPs) and hundreds of forum responses. Without this, governance bottlenecks and the protocol cannot adapt to market conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>No cross-SP coordination.</strong> Asset listings, chain deployments, and economic reforms each require alignment across risk, technical, treasury, and governance teams. Without someone running that pipeline, proposals slow down, partner capital arrives late, and opportunities get identified after the window closes. If at all.</li>\n<li><strong>No Plasma.</strong> $2.3B TVL and $5.9M annualized revenue directly attributable to our deployment coordination and incentive management.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Execution is not a one-time event. Revenue engines decay. Without the next strategy already in the pipeline, growth reverses.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61756-conclusion-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61756-conclusion-20\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We have cost the Aave DAO $4.625M since November 2022.

The Reserve Factor revenue from these borrows ($5.8M/yr) is directly attributable to the Ethena strategy: without the collateral onboarding and eMode configuration we designed, this borrow demand does not exist on Aave. The LRT loop also drives stablecoin borrow demand not captured in the 48% floor, pushing the true figure higher.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61756-revenue-by-chain-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61756-revenue-by-chain-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Revenue by Chain</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/5a830a70ffc41ed4f688ec738d430935eb85adbd.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/cUHJ0tIJRoUqsB8RC3xXTq6f3fD.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Revenue by Chain\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/5a830a70ffc41ed4f688ec738d430935eb85adbd.jpeg\" alt=\"Revenue by Chain\" data-base62-sha1=\"cUHJ0tIJRoUqsB8RC3xXTq6f3fD\" width=\"1800\" height=\"996\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><em>Plasma\u2019s accelerating trajectory is detailed below.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61756-revenue-by-asset-2025-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61756-revenue-by-asset-2025-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Revenue by Asset (2025)</h3>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/1a3c54c5e020eacd658c1120a13459758e8bb9d1.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3K5FJrvlYPpcaoaGqPDZ7ZxkLFn.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Revenue by Asset (2025)\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/1a3c54c5e020eacd658c1120a13459758e8bb9d1.jpeg\" alt=\"Revenue by Asset (2025)\" data-base62-sha1=\"3K5FJrvlYPpcaoaGqPDZ7ZxkLFn\" width=\"1800\" height=\"996\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><em>On-chain verification: V3 pool scan confirms WETH at $33.0M/yr at current rates (gap vs $37.0M = ETH price decline, not reduced activity; ETH-denominated borrowing grew +12%).</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61756-the-plasma-story-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61756-the-plasma-story-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>The Plasma Story</h3>\n<p>Plasma is the clearest single example.

What Would Aave Look Like Without ACI?</h2>\n<p>Fair question. Tokenholders should ask it about every service provider.</p>\n<p>Without us:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No incentive management.</strong> $101M in campaigns (DAO + partner-funded) would not have been designed, deployed, or optimized. Every competitor runs their own incentive programs. Without ours, Aave\u2019s TVL growth stalls and competitors close the gap.</li>\n<li><strong>No LRT revenue engine.</strong> The recursive loop that generates $37M/yr does not get built. weETH does not get onboarded. Reserve Factors do not get optimized. WETH borrows stay at $1.1B instead of $5.87B.</li>\n<li><strong>No Ethena capture.</strong> At peak, $6.8B on Aave. Without us, that capital flows to Morpho, which generates zero protocol revenue from it.</li>\n<li><strong>No Skywards pipeline.</strong> Asset onboarding would rely on individual proposers navigating governance alone. RLUSD, EURC, USDe, and dozens of other assets would have been listed later or not at all.</li>\n<li><strong>No GHO growth engine.</strong> The sGHO framework, cross-chain expansion, and $12M in targeted incentives are our contribution to a joint effort with TokenLogic. Without our half, the growth engine stalls.</li>\n<li><strong>No MASIv partnerships.</strong> $80M in external partner funding does not flow into Aave without a team managing those relationships.</li>\n<li><strong>No governance throughput.</strong> 61% of all governance actions since ACI started (845 Snapshots and AIPs) and hundreds of forum responses. Without this, governance bottlenecks and the protocol cannot adapt to market conditions.</li>\n<li><strong>No cross-SP coordination.</strong> Asset listings, chain deployments, and economic reforms each require alignment across risk, technical, treasury, and governance teams. Without someone running that pipeline, proposals slow down, partner capital arrives late, and opportunities get identified after the window closes. If at all.</li>\n<li><strong>No Plasma.</strong> $2.3B TVL and $5.9M annualized revenue directly attributable to our deployment coordination and incentive management.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Execution is not a one-time event. Revenue engines decay. Without the next strategy already in the pipeline, growth reverses.</strong></p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61756-conclusion-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61756-conclusion-20\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>We have cost the Aave DAO $4.625M since November 2022.

Summary</h2>\n<p>This proposal introduces <strong>Maxshot AI</strong> to the Aave community as a complementary, value-accretive yield optimization and distribution layer.</p>\n<p>As Maxshot is already integrated with Aave V3 markets across multiple chains, this proposal does <strong>not</strong> request any protocol parameter changes, risk parameter updates, or direct integrations. Instead, it seeks community awareness, feedback, and formal ecosystem recognition of Maxshot as a third-party strategy operator that enhances capital efficiency and user experience for Aave.</p>\n<p>By leveraging AI-driven, non-discretionary agents, Maxshot simplifies access to optimized, omni-chain yield opportunities, with the goal of increasing total value locked (TVL), capital efficiency, and liquidity stickiness across Aave markets.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2. Abstract</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI operates as an intelligent yield optimization layer built on top of Aave and other DeFi protocols. It automatically routes and rebalances capital across chains and markets using deterministic, AI-driven agents to maximize risk-adjusted returns.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to align the Aave community with an existing ecosystem partner that already contributes capital flows into Aave liquidity pools and improves user access to yield opportunities without introducing additional protocol risk.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3. Motivation</h2>\n<p>Aave is a foundational DeFi liquidity protocol with robust risk management, transparent governance, and deployments across multiple networks. While its multi-chain expansion is a core strength, it also introduces structural inefficiencies that create opportunities for complementary, user-layer optimization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-challenges-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-challenges-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Key Challenges</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Fragmentation:</strong> Liquidity is distributed across multiple Aave deployments, requiring users to manually bridge assets, compare rates, and manage positions across chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> Actively managing positions across multiple markets and networks is time-intensive and costly, leading to suboptimal capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Uneven Utilization:</strong> Friction at the user layer can result in idle liquidity and inconsistent utilization across Aave markets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Maxshot\u2019s Role</h3>\n<p>Maxshot AI acts as a non-custodial, intelligent routing and optimization layer on top of Aave, improving capital efficiency and user experience through automated, rules-based yield optimization\u2014without modifying or competing with Aave\u2019s core protocol.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4. Specification: Maxshot Overview</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI Agent Factory, an AI-native, automation-first infrastructure layer designed to build, deploy, and coordinate autonomous agents for on-chain capital optimization.</p>\n<p>At its core, Maxshot provides a standardized framework for creating protocol-aware, risk-constrained AI agents that can observe market conditions, reason over strategy sets, and execute actions across DeFi systems. These agents operate continuously within predefined risk models and governance-aligned parameters, enabling scalable and transparent automation at the infrastructure level.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Key Characteristics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deterministic, Continuous Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Agents operate autonomously and continuously, responding to market changes without manual intervention. All decisions follow transparent, rules-based logic that is auditable and verifiable on-chain, eliminating discretionary risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Full On-Chain Transparency</strong></p>\n<p>Every allocation, rebalance, and performance metric is recorded on-chain and available for real-time community review, enabling ongoing verification of compliance and protocol impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Maxshot enforces a strict separation between optimization logic (Strategy Layer), safety constraints (Risk Layer), and on-chain interactions (Execution Layer). This design ensures that strategy decisions cannot bypass risk controls and that all actions remain auditable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first flagship product built on this framework is <strong>Maxshot Omni Yield Aggregator</strong>, an omni-chain, multi-protocol yield optimization system live across multiple blockchains. Powered by a coordinated network of autonomous agents, the aggregator dynamically allocates capital in real time rather than relying on static strategies or manual rebalancing.</p>\n<p>As the agent factory expands, Maxshot is designed to support new on-chain use cases beyond yield optimization, while maintaining strict alignment with protocol risk frameworks and ecosystem incentives.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>5. Technical Architecture</h2>\n<p>Maxshot follows a protocol-agnostic, modular architecture optimized for transparency, security, and auditability. The system consists of three distinct layers:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Strategy Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Defines optimization logic and allocation objectives by analyzing real-time market data across Aave and other protocols. It generates allocation recommendations but has no execution authority.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-risk-layer-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-risk-layer-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Acts as the system\u2019s safety guardrail, enforcing predefined constraints such as protocol, asset, and chain exposure limits. Any action that violates these rules is automatically blocked and logged for transparency.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-execution-layer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-execution-layer-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Execution Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Handles all on-chain operations, including deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing. Execution is deterministic and fully auditable, and only proceeds after Risk Layer approval.</p>\n<p>This three-layer architecture ensures that strategy optimization, risk management, and execution transparency are never compromised. Each layer operates independently, and no single layer has authority over the entire system. This design reduces the risk of catastrophic failures and ensures that the Aave community retains full visibility and control over Maxshot\u2019s operations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>6. Rationale &amp; Differentiation</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI-native, automation-native financial infrastructure designed to manage and optimize on-chain financial activities.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional yield aggregators that rely on static strategies or manual rebalancing, Maxshot operates as a network of non-discretionary, autonomous agents that continuously evaluate market conditions and execute allocation decisions in real time, strictly within predefined risk constraints and governance-aligned parameters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-core-advantages-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-core-advantages-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Core Advantages</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Omni-chain, Multi-protocol Optimization</strong></p>\n<p>Capital is optimized globally across chains and protocols rather than siloed within a single deployment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Agent-driven (Non-discretionary) Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Deterministic agents execute strategies continuously without human intervention or discretionary decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Strategy, Risk, and Execution</strong></p>\n<p>A modular architecture enforces clear boundaries between optimization logic, risk controls, and execution, enhancing security, transparency, and independent auditability.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This architecture allows Maxshot to function not merely as a yield aggregator, but as a general-purpose AI agent platform, where additional agents (such as risk agents, liquidity routing agents, governance-aware execution agents, and protocol-specific strategy agents) can be composed and deployed over time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>7. Live Deployments &amp; Metrics</h2>\n<p>Maxshot has been live in production since December 2025, and has already attracted meaningful TVL, demonstrating operational readiness and early market validation.</p>\n<p>The platform currently manages approximately $9.8M in total TVL across live deployments, including ~$1.8M in the Omni USDC vault.

Summary</h2>\n<p>This proposal introduces <strong>Maxshot AI</strong> to the Aave community as a complementary, value-accretive yield optimization and distribution layer.</p>\n<p>As Maxshot is already integrated with Aave V3 markets across multiple chains, this proposal does <strong>not</strong> request any protocol parameter changes, risk parameter updates, or direct integrations. Instead, it seeks community awareness, feedback, and formal ecosystem recognition of Maxshot as a third-party strategy operator that enhances capital efficiency and user experience for Aave.</p>\n<p>By leveraging AI-driven, non-discretionary agents, Maxshot simplifies access to optimized, omni-chain yield opportunities, with the goal of increasing total value locked (TVL), capital efficiency, and liquidity stickiness across Aave markets.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2. Abstract</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI operates as an intelligent yield optimization layer built on top of Aave and other DeFi protocols. It automatically routes and rebalances capital across chains and markets using deterministic, AI-driven agents to maximize risk-adjusted returns.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to align the Aave community with an existing ecosystem partner that already contributes capital flows into Aave liquidity pools and improves user access to yield opportunities without introducing additional protocol risk.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3. Motivation</h2>\n<p>Aave is a foundational DeFi liquidity protocol with robust risk management, transparent governance, and deployments across multiple networks. While its multi-chain expansion is a core strength, it also introduces structural inefficiencies that create opportunities for complementary, user-layer optimization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-challenges-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-challenges-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Key Challenges</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Fragmentation:</strong> Liquidity is distributed across multiple Aave deployments, requiring users to manually bridge assets, compare rates, and manage positions across chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> Actively managing positions across multiple markets and networks is time-intensive and costly, leading to suboptimal capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Uneven Utilization:</strong> Friction at the user layer can result in idle liquidity and inconsistent utilization across Aave markets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Maxshot\u2019s Role</h3>\n<p>Maxshot AI acts as a non-custodial, intelligent routing and optimization layer on top of Aave, improving capital efficiency and user experience through automated, rules-based yield optimization\u2014without modifying or competing with Aave\u2019s core protocol.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4. Specification: Maxshot Overview</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI Agent Factory, an AI-native, automation-first infrastructure layer designed to build, deploy, and coordinate autonomous agents for on-chain capital optimization.</p>\n<p>At its core, Maxshot provides a standardized framework for creating protocol-aware, risk-constrained AI agents that can observe market conditions, reason over strategy sets, and execute actions across DeFi systems. These agents operate continuously within predefined risk models and governance-aligned parameters, enabling scalable and transparent automation at the infrastructure level.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Key Characteristics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deterministic, Continuous Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Agents operate autonomously and continuously, responding to market changes without manual intervention. All decisions follow transparent, rules-based logic that is auditable and verifiable on-chain, eliminating discretionary risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Full On-Chain Transparency</strong></p>\n<p>Every allocation, rebalance, and performance metric is recorded on-chain and available for real-time community review, enabling ongoing verification of compliance and protocol impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Maxshot enforces a strict separation between optimization logic (Strategy Layer), safety constraints (Risk Layer), and on-chain interactions (Execution Layer). This design ensures that strategy decisions cannot bypass risk controls and that all actions remain auditable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first flagship product built on this framework is <strong>Maxshot Omni Yield Aggregator</strong>, an omni-chain, multi-protocol yield optimization system live across multiple blockchains. Powered by a coordinated network of autonomous agents, the aggregator dynamically allocates capital in real time rather than relying on static strategies or manual rebalancing.</p>\n<p>As the agent factory expands, Maxshot is designed to support new on-chain use cases beyond yield optimization, while maintaining strict alignment with protocol risk frameworks and ecosystem incentives.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>5. Technical Architecture</h2>\n<p>Maxshot follows a protocol-agnostic, modular architecture optimized for transparency, security, and auditability. The system consists of three distinct layers:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Strategy Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Defines optimization logic and allocation objectives by analyzing real-time market data across Aave and other protocols. It generates allocation recommendations but has no execution authority.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-risk-layer-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-risk-layer-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Acts as the system\u2019s safety guardrail, enforcing predefined constraints such as protocol, asset, and chain exposure limits. Any action that violates these rules is automatically blocked and logged for transparency.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-execution-layer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-execution-layer-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Execution Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Handles all on-chain operations, including deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing. Execution is deterministic and fully auditable, and only proceeds after Risk Layer approval.</p>\n<p>This three-layer architecture ensures that strategy optimization, risk management, and execution transparency are never compromised. Each layer operates independently, and no single layer has authority over the entire system. This design reduces the risk of catastrophic failures and ensures that the Aave community retains full visibility and control over Maxshot\u2019s operations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>6. Rationale &amp; Differentiation</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI-native, automation-native financial infrastructure designed to manage and optimize on-chain financial activities.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional yield aggregators that rely on static strategies or manual rebalancing, Maxshot operates as a network of non-discretionary, autonomous agents that continuously evaluate market conditions and execute allocation decisions in real time, strictly within predefined risk constraints and governance-aligned parameters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-core-advantages-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-core-advantages-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Core Advantages</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Omni-chain, Multi-protocol Optimization</strong></p>\n<p>Capital is optimized globally across chains and protocols rather than siloed within a single deployment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Agent-driven (Non-discretionary) Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Deterministic agents execute strategies continuously without human intervention or discretionary decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Strategy, Risk, and Execution</strong></p>\n<p>A modular architecture enforces clear boundaries between optimization logic, risk controls, and execution, enhancing security, transparency, and independent auditability.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This architecture allows Maxshot to function not merely as a yield aggregator, but as a general-purpose AI agent platform, where additional agents (such as risk agents, liquidity routing agents, governance-aware execution agents, and protocol-specific strategy agents) can be composed and deployed over time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>7. Live Deployments &amp; Metrics</h2>\n<p>Maxshot has been live in production since December 2025, and has already attracted meaningful TVL, demonstrating operational readiness and early market validation.</p>\n<p>The platform currently manages approximately $9.8M in total TVL across live deployments, including ~$1.8M in the Omni USDC vault.

Summary</h1>\n<p>Aave began with the thesis that decentralized lending could play a major role in traditional finance. Eight years later, that thesis has been validated. Aave is the largest protocol in decentralized finance, commanding a 60% market share in lending. The opportunity ahead, however, is bigger than anything behind us.</p>\n<p>Detailed below is a strategic framework proposal for Aave\u2019s next chapter. It asks the Aave DAO to ratify Aave V4 as the protocol\u2019s foundational technology for future growth. It also proposes to direct all revenue from Aave-branded products built to the DAO treasury and to establish a budget for continued development. It also includes a solution to protect the Aave brand.</p>\n<p>This proposal asks the DAO to approve the following operational framework:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Direct 100% of Aave-branded product revenue to the Aave DAO treasury.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Commit to a solution for protecting the Aave brand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ratify Aave V4 as the protocol\u2019s core technical foundation for future development.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a framework for the DAO to fund strategic growth and development.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-h-2-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-h-2-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2. Motivation</h1>\n<p>The LEND token sale in 2017 raised $16M to build a decentralized lending protocol. That protocol became Aave, and that $16M has grown into a multi-billion dollar ecosystem, creating billions in value in the process.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Aave Labs has requested DAO funds only for direct protocol development and marketing activities. Everything else has been self-funded. This includes the product layer, which encompasses <a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a>, the Aave mobile app, Aave Pro, Aave Kit, and Aave Horizon. It also includes legal and regulatory work such as SEC defense, brand protection, trademark management, and compliance. Business development and growth has been self-funded as well.</p>\n<p><strong>We are now entering one of the most important periods that will determine Aave\u2019s success going forward.</strong> Fintechs are entering DeFi, institutions are coming onchain, and regulatory clarity is emerging in certain markets that allows us to go direct to consumers. The protocols that win the next decade will be those that move fast, build great tools and products, and capture new markets before competitors. With the right focus, and by investing in important growth areas, Aave is positioned to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>Other approaches to this framework exist, however they have different trade-offs. Aave Labs could operate independently and keep product revenue to fund itself, but then there would need to be a separation of the protocol revenues from the ones generated by the Aave-branded products built on top of the protocol. The DAO could directly build and operate Aave-branded products through governance, but the execution would be slow, and governance overhead can\u2019t scale indefinitely to meet the pace required.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-h-3-specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-h-3-specification-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3.

This has supported millions of users with zero security incidents. The DAO has matured quite a bit since AIP-1 and we believe it\u2019s time to align behind a token-centric model.</p>\n<p>Under this proposal, 100% of Aave Labs\u2019 product revenue will go to the DAO. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a>, the existing interface, and all associated fees</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave App, the consumer mobile application</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Card, a card tied to Aave App with all fees flowing to the DAO</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Pro, the new interface for Aave V4</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Kit, enterprise solutions for fintechs and institutions building on Aave</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Horizon, Aave\u2019s RWA market and institutional services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AAVE ETP, exchange traded product of $AAVE</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upon approval of this proposal, the DAO would also receive revenue from the swap integration on <a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a>, which currently generates approximately $10 million in annualized revenue. This integration is expected to expand to additional chains and functionality.</p>\n<p>Revenue is defined as gross product revenue earned by Aave Labs, minus any direct revenue sharing paid by Aave Labs to external partners including revenue rebates, revenue subsidies, revenue sharing arrangements and any additional direct user incentives.</p>\n<p>Product growth incentive budgets are funded by the Aave DAO. Additionally, Aave Labs retains the discretion to redirect a portion of product inflows, such as vault yields, directly into user incentives. Competing for users requires the ability to deploy capital quickly toward growth without waiting for a governance cycle. In these instances, Aave Labs will disclose additional user incentives spending in our quarterly updates.</p>\n<p>With proper execution, the product layer can be an additional source of revenue for the DAO treasury. Combined with protocol fees, the DAO can fund its own growth, security, and development from a diversified revenue stream.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61633-expanding-revenue-through-aave-v4-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-expanding-revenue-through-aave-v4-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Expanding Revenue Through Aave V4</h3>\n<p>The product layer is one part of the path to increasing the DAO\u2019s annual revenue. The protocol layer, powered by Aave V4, is the other. Aave V3 already generates over $100 million in annualized revenue. <strong>Aave V4 expands on V3 with new monetization features that allow the protocol to capture more value from the risk it underwrites.</strong></p>\n<p>V4\u2019s architecture also unlocks revenue streams that are not easily possible in previous Aave versions. Each Spoke can extend Aave into a new market or use case, with its own risk parameters and revenue model. <strong>As with V3, 100% of Aave V4\u2019s protocol revenue will go to the DAO.</strong></p>\n<p>We\u2019ve taken a look at various products and protocols across the crypto and fintech industries to show estimations that highlight the size of the opportunities available:</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/88a6f6078bfb1e91bb94699454f2ced4f23e7dca.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/juSEcoGK2H8QMCwiFniNnK96vH4.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"spoke-revenue-data\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/88a6f6078bfb1e91bb94699454f2ced4f23e7dca.jpeg\" alt=\"spoke-revenue-data\" data-base62-sha1=\"juSEcoGK2H8QMCwiFniNnK96vH4\" width=\"1921\" height=\"1046\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/96af8851eb834d92d90a03bb53f127b1515f6051.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/lv1He5EH2wxO64MZvptA8muFHIB.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"revenue-flow-diagram\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/96af8851eb834d92d90a03bb53f127b1515f6051.jpeg\" alt=\"revenue-flow-diagram\" data-base62-sha1=\"lv1He5EH2wxO64MZvptA8muFHIB\" width=\"1921\" height=\"1046\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><em>* These opportunity estimates are based on other protocols or products in each category (e.g. Pendle, Fluid), and the size of the opportunity (e.g. OTC lending volume), etc. They each represent a net new revenue opportunity on top of what Aave generates today, and they are only possible to pursue in a scalable way once V4 is live. Reaching these estimates would also depend on market conditions, scale of adoption, and execution.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Aave V4 also introduces a new reinvestment module, which is an optional net new revenue opportunity for the DAO to consider.</strong> Aave pools maintain a significant idle float that currently earns nothing. This reinvestment feature allows the protocol to sweep this capital into short-term, low-risk yield opportunities pre-vetted and approved by the DAO, similar to a collateral listing.</p>\n<p>When Aave rates fall below SOFR-rates, it signals underutilized liquidity that could be productively deployed.

Adding new features to V3 requires modifying core protocol logic, which involves extensive audits and significant coordination overhead. <strong>Meanwhile V4\u2019s architecture allows new functionality to be added through Spokes without touching the core, making experimentation cheaper, faster, and safer.</strong></p>\n<p>Importantly, anything V3 does can be recreated on V4, but not vice versa. <strong>V4 is a strict superset of V3\u2019s capabilities, meaning no functionality is lost in the upgrade.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>V4\u2019s architecture expands the range of revenue models the protocol can support, which is why governance analysis considers higher-scale revenue scenarios when planning long-term operations.</strong> To capture the opportunities outlined above, Aave Labs and the rest of the DAO\u2019s service providers should coordinate development efforts around V4. This means prioritizing V4 Spoke development, aligning roadmaps, and shifting new feature work away from V3. Notably, V4 is already live on testnet, has completed an open security contest, and has its first <a href=\"https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2026-02-aave-v4-securityreview.pdf\">public audit</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The DAO is being asked to agree on this strategic direction and a separate proposal will follow for V4 protocol activation, the launch setup, etc.</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61633-v3-maintenance-plan-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-v3-maintenance-plan-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>V3 Maintenance Plan</h3>\n<p>That said, <strong>V3 should not be shut down hastily or haphazardly.</strong> V3 is stable, mature, and battle-tested. There is no need for a rushed, or forced, migration, and the transition should happen in three phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Active Development (Current). V3 remains the primary production system, with security patches, parameter updates, and critical maintenance continuing as normal. It also makes sense to pause any new features for V3 if this framework is passed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stable Maintenance (Upon V4 Launch). V4 becomes the primary technology layer for expansion and innovation. V3 documentation, tooling, and access points remain fully supported, and users migrate at their own pace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Legacy Support (8-12 Months After V4 Launch). Once V4 is mature, V3 parameters should be gradually adjusted to encourage migration, following the same approach used in past version transitions. V3 remains open indefinitely for withdrawals, with governance stepping in only for critical security issues.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>If the DAO ratifies this strategic direction, coordination among service providers will be important for efficient execution.</strong> Service providers funded by the DAO can align their work with this direction to maintain Aave\u2019s competitive position. Those who prefer to focus on different priorities can adjust their scope accordingly.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61633-aave-brand-governance-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-aave-brand-governance-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Aave Brand Governance</h2>\n<p>The Aave brand is one of the protocol\u2019s most important assets, built over years of technical excellence, security track record, and community trust. Protecting it is in the best interest of the DAO, token holders, and the broader ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Today, Aave Labs is the exclusive legal owner of the Aave trademarks and has been solely responsible for holding, defending, and enforcing them.</strong> Because the DAO is not a legal entity, it cannot directly hold or defend trademarks. As a result, trademark stewardship has necessarily sat within Aave Labs.</p>\n<p><strong>For the past seven years, Aave Labs has carried this operational burden, and the work is hands-on, expensive, and necessary.</strong> <strong>Trademarks that are not actively and consistently defended can be weakened or lost</strong>, reducing the ability to control how a mark is used in commerce and increasing the risk of misuse or confusion.</p>\n<p>At the same time, there are understandable concerns around concentrating long-term control of such a critical asset within a single operating entity, particularly as the DAO continues to mature. <strong>To address this, and subject to DAO approval, Aave Labs proposes the creation of a Foundation that would assume responsibility for holding and stewarding the Aave trademarks going forward.</strong> The Foundation would be mandated to protect the brand, license it to approved entities, address unauthorized use, and operate in alignment with DAO-approved parameters.</p>\n<p>The details regarding the structure, governance, and execution of this Foundation, including any transfer or licensing of trademark rights, as well as proposed approaches to V4 codebase licensing, will be presented to the DAO in a follow-up proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61633-aave-market-access-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-aave-market-access-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>$AAVE Market Access</h2>\n<p>To go beyond the product/protocol layer and expand market access to $AAVE, <strong>Aave Labs will support partners to launch regulated, traditional market products referencing $AAVE as the underlying asset</strong>. This includes the potential launch of $AAVE regulated futures, as well as a regulated spot exchange-traded product (ETP).</p>\n<p>The introduction of regulated futures and ETP products would represent a meaningful step toward institutional maturity for Aave, broadening access for professional and traditional investors. A standalone proposal covering structure and execution will follow under the workstreams authorized by this proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61633-dao-growth-requires-resources-at-scale-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-dao-growth-requires-resources-at-scale-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>DAO Growth Requires Resources At Scale</h2>\n<p>The operational framework outlined above requires execution at scale that matches the opportunity. <strong>For Aave to scale and play a role in the real financial system, it should allocate resources in growth the way fintechs, banks, and other financial institutions do.</strong> Without commitment to this as a goal, Aave\u2019s upside will always be limited. If all of Aave Labs\u2019 product revenue flows to the DAO, the DAO would need to fund the ongoing development and growth of these products.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61633-aave-labs-funding-request-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-aave-labs-funding-request-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Aave Labs Funding Request</h3>\n<p>The DAO is facing a structural decision regarding Aave Labs\u2019 operating model going forward.</p>\n<p>Currently, Aave Labs self-funds a significant portion of its operations. Historically, the ecosystem\u2019s direction of travel (via AIP-1) was to use fees generated by Aave-branded products, such as <a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a> and other product surfaces, to cover Aave Labs\u2019 product development, marketing, legal, and operational costs, while the DAO funded direct protocol version development carried out by Aave Labs.</p>\n<p>Under the proposed operational framework, all fees from Aave-branded products would go to the DAO treasury rather than supporting Aave Labs\u2019 operations and product development. In this configuration, the responsibility for funding Aave Labs\u2019 activities would shift correspondingly to the DAO.</p>\n<p>Aave Labs requests $25 million in stablecoins, 75,000 AAVE, with additional growth and development grants payable upon specific product launches. The funding would be structured as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Primary Grant:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>$5 million paid upfront upon approval of the proposal and $20 million streamed over the course of the year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>75,000 AAVE delivered upon approval of the proposal, unlocking linearly monthly over a 2 year period</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Growth/Development Grants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>$5,000,000 for Aave App launch, with funds used for user acquisition, marketing, and ongoing development</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$5,000,000 for Aave Pro launch, with funds used for user acquisition, marketing, and ongoing development</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$5,000,000 for Aave Card launch, with funds used for user acquisition, marketing, and ongoing development</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$2,500,000 for Aave Kit launch, with funds used for maintenance and marketing</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: For clarity, all funds will be spent on Aave-related efforts.</em></p>\n<p>Growth and development grants are released upon delivery and streamed over a period of six months, with governance confirming completion before funds are disbursed. They cover the cost of bringing each product to market, from engineering through go-to-market.</p>\n<p>Companies entering DeFi are well-capitalized and spending aggressively on product and distribution. To succeed in the market, Aave needs to invest at a similar scale. This commitment allows for long-term planning, aggressive hiring, and sustained investment in product and go-to-market without the friction of annual budget cycles.</p>\n<p>The funding requested is a significant expansion of scope beyond historical funding. To date, Aave Labs has largely self-funded the cost of building and scaling the product layer, seeking DAO support mainly for core protocol development and focused marketing. This proposal secures the investment needed to stay competitive and continue innovating over the next decade. Growing Aave and growing it to the scale of other TradFi alternatives requires stable, predictable funding so contributors can plan, hire, and execute at the standard of a global financial platform.</p>\n<p>Altogether, these funds are covering the following costs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Continued protocol development (V4 improvements, Spokes, core infrastructure, research, and development)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product engineering across Aave Pro, Aave App, Aave Kit, and other products</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product go-to-market, user acquisition, marketing (e.g. social media/SEO/content) and growth</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Business development</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Labs invests heavily in partnering with the largest institutional and fintech names to integrate with Aave.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Horizon asset onboarding and driving TVL/borrow growth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ongoing 360\u00b0 resource provision for institutional integrators, including technical, InfoSec and operational support.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application security</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave Labs runs an extensive monitoring program, and very heavy enterprise fees to social media platforms, to protect the Aave brand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Events, which historically Aave Labs has already run with funding from the DAO (e.g. rAAVE, DeFi Day)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With this capital, Aave Labs can build with the runway needed to succeed on the items outlined above. It would also reflect the DAO\u2019s decision to fund the level of execution required to support protocol operations at increased scale, should governance determine that expansion is warranted.</p>\n<p>In order to be as effective as possible, Aave Labs would retain autonomy over product strategy and operations. Building competitive products requires the ability to move quickly, make decisions without committee approval, and iterate based on market feedback. We suggest the same for other Service Providers who might choose to operate under this framework.</p>\n<p>The grants outlined above are for one year and would need to be revisited, if approved, 12 months after the proposal is decided on.</p>\n<p>In line with existing DAO practices, oversight of this work is exercised through governance. Aave Labs will provide regular transparency into its activities, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Quarterly updates on progress against funded initiatives, key metrics, and use of DAO-authorized resources</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ongoing updates on active workstreams and prioritization decisions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Continued open and responsive communication with the DAO through established governance channels</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61633-h-4-next-steps-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-h-4-next-steps-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4. Next Steps</h2>\n<p>Aave remains early in its journey. What exists today is a base layer, while the real scale of adoption lies ahead as global finance moves onchain. DeFi is still quite small in the grand scheme of things. And over the coming decades, trillions of dollars in assets will migrate onto open rails. In that world, Aave can become the core infrastructure for global finance.</p>\n<p>Since 2017, the focus has been on disciplined execution at the frontier, and that conviction has only strengthened. The next phase of growth, fueled by innovation, and institutional adoption will be led by Aave. With sustained commitment and effective execution, the protocol can support significantly greater scale over time and continue establishing itself as core liquidity infrastructure for the onchain economy.</p>\n<p>This proposal seeks to establish a framework for Aave\u2019s next decade. Upon approval, it would reaffirm Aave Labs\u2019 alignment with the DAO by directing all Aave-branded product revenue to the DAO treasury. It asks for the ratification of V4 as the technical foundation for this growth and for the funding to execute this vision. This framework\u2019s objective is to position the Aave Protocol as a core piece of global financial infrastructure, with the value it creates directed to the Aave DAO to fund its continued development and success.</p>\n<p>In accordance with Aave governance processes, this proposal is intended as an initial Temp Check to gather community feedback on the strategic direction outlined above. Any  commitments, structural changes, or funding allocations would proceed through the appropriate stages of discussion, refinement, and governance proposal stages prior to implementation.</p>\n<p>If the Temp Check is successful and the community supports this proposal, we will move forward with a formal ARFC submission.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-disclaimer-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-disclaimer-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclaimer</h1>\n<p>Historically, Aave Labs has self-funded its endeavors. Due to the nature of the proposal, Aave Labs would receive funding from the DAO in exchange for Aave Labs\u2019 revenue going to the DAO if passed. No third parties co-authored this proposal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-copyright-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-copyright-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Copyright</h1>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">Creative Commons Zero (CC0)</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-faq-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-faq-16\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>FAQ</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Why are so many significant items grouped into a single proposal? Shouldn\u2019t these be separate votes?</strong></p>\n<p>This proposal presents a single, cohesive strategy. The components are interconnected and depend on each other for success. For example, aligning on V4 as the core technical foundation informs how development efforts are prioritized, while the proposed funding framework supports coordinated execution across protocol and product workstreams. Voting on these items separately could result in a fragmented and unworkable plan. Approving the strategy without the technology, or the technology without the funding to build it, would be inefficient. This proposal is a complete strategic package, and voting on it as a whole ensures the DAO is aligned on a single, comprehensive path forward.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The funding request is substantial. Why does Aave Labs need this budget?</strong></p>\n<p>The requested budget reflects a deliberate shift in operating model rather than an incremental extension of past funding. Historically, Aave Labs subsidized a broad range of activities and requested DAO support primarily for direct protocol development and focused marketing. Under this framework, the DAO is choosing to fund a wider operational scope directly, including product engineering, go-to-market execution, product relevant legal and compliance work, and business development. This budget is intended to support long-term planning and execution at scale and to enable stable resourcing and sustained focus. It reflects a governance decision about how the DAO wishes to resource protocol-adjacent work as Aave engages more directly with an evolving and increasingly competitive market landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Why should the DAO fund Aave Labs now if it has been self-funded for so long?</strong></p>\n<p>By directing 100% of revenue to the DAO, Aave Labs will not be able to self-fund going forward. Without the ability to earn or raise revenue, there is no way to cover the costs across product development, business development, and other operational functions Aave Labs has historically funded. Without funding to continue this work these functions would stop.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Is this funding request annual?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Aave Labs will submit an annual budget proposal to the DAO for the work it performs. Each year\u2019s budget requires a separate governance vote, giving the DAO ongoing oversight of how funds are allocated.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What does \u201cautonomy\u201d mean in this proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>The proposal requests autonomy over certain operational and product strategy decisions. Building competitive products requires the ability to move quickly and iterate based on market feedback, which is difficult if every decision requires a vote. Accountability is central to this arrangement. Aave Labs commits to providing quarterly reports on progress, frequent updates on development, and continued open communication with the DAO. The DAO retains ultimate oversight through its control of the treasury and Aave Labs\u2019 funding stream. If Aave Labs does not meet its commitments or perform effectively, the DAO can choose not to continue contributing to this budget.</p>\n<p><strong>6. What does ratifying V4 mean in this proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>This vote asks the DAO to agree on a strategic direction. Ratifying V4 in this proposal means committing to it as the core technical foundation for future development. It signals to all service providers that V4 is the priority, allowing them to align their roadmaps and development efforts. This coordination is necessary to build the features that will achieve the proposal\u2019s goals. The subsequent vote to activate the V4 protocol will be a purely technical one, focused on the readiness of the code, launch parameters, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Why is there compensation tied to milestones?</strong></p>\n<p>Launching and scaling products involves costs beyond core development work. This includes go-to-market execution, partnership development, and ongoing operational support around the time a product is introduced. The milestone-based payments are intended to support these activities at key delivery points, aligning resourcing with product rollout. As all revenue from these products flows to the DAO, funding this work supports execution that directly contributes to the protocol\u2019s operational sustainability.</p>\n<p><strong>8. How does this framework impact other Service Providers working with the Aave DAO?</strong></p>\n<p>If the DAO ratifies this proposal, coordination among service providers will be important for efficient execution. Service providers funded by the DAO can align their work with this direction to maintain Aave\u2019s competitive position. Those who prefer to focus on different priorities can propose adjusting their scope accordingly. Additionally, the increased surface area for revenue generation established by this proposal creates a framework that other service providers can consider for their own work with the DAO.</p>\n            <p><small>73 posts - 41 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-will-win-framework/24055\">Read full topic</a></p>\n          ",

Summary</h1>\n<p>Aave began with the thesis that decentralized lending could play a major role in traditional finance. Eight years later, that thesis has been validated. Aave is the largest protocol in decentralized finance, commanding a 60% market share in lending. The opportunity ahead, however, is bigger than anything behind us.</p>\n<p>Detailed below is a strategic framework proposal for Aave\u2019s next chapter. It asks the Aave DAO to ratify Aave V4 as the protocol\u2019s foundational technology for future growth. It also proposes to direct all revenue from Aave-branded products built to the DAO treasury and to establish a budget for continued development. It also includes a solution to protect the Aave brand.</p>\n<p>This proposal asks the DAO to approve the following operational framework:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Direct 100% of Aave-branded product revenue to the Aave DAO treasury.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Commit to a solution for protecting the Aave brand.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ratify Aave V4 as the protocol\u2019s core technical foundation for future development.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a framework for the DAO to fund strategic growth and development.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-h-2-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-h-2-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2. Motivation</h1>\n<p>The LEND token sale in 2017 raised $16M to build a decentralized lending protocol. That protocol became Aave, and that $16M has grown into a multi-billion dollar ecosystem, creating billions in value in the process.</p>\n<p>Along the way, Aave Labs has requested DAO funds only for direct protocol development and marketing activities. Everything else has been self-funded. This includes the product layer, which encompasses <a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a>, the Aave mobile app, Aave Pro, Aave Kit, and Aave Horizon. It also includes legal and regulatory work such as SEC defense, brand protection, trademark management, and compliance. Business development and growth has been self-funded as well.</p>\n<p><strong>We are now entering one of the most important periods that will determine Aave\u2019s success going forward.</strong> Fintechs are entering DeFi, institutions are coming onchain, and regulatory clarity is emerging in certain markets that allows us to go direct to consumers. The protocols that win the next decade will be those that move fast, build great tools and products, and capture new markets before competitors. With the right focus, and by investing in important growth areas, Aave is positioned to do exactly that.</p>\n<p>Other approaches to this framework exist, however they have different trade-offs. Aave Labs could operate independently and keep product revenue to fund itself, but then there would need to be a separation of the protocol revenues from the ones generated by the Aave-branded products built on top of the protocol. The DAO could directly build and operate Aave-branded products through governance, but the execution would be slow, and governance overhead can\u2019t scale indefinitely to meet the pace required.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-h-3-specification-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-h-3-specification-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3.

This has supported millions of users with zero security incidents. The DAO has matured quite a bit since AIP-1 and we believe it\u2019s time to align behind a token-centric model.</p>\n<p>Under this proposal, 100% of Aave Labs\u2019 product revenue will go to the DAO. This includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a>, the existing interface, and all associated fees</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave App, the consumer mobile application</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Card, a card tied to Aave App with all fees flowing to the DAO</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Pro, the new interface for Aave V4</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Kit, enterprise solutions for fintechs and institutions building on Aave</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Horizon, Aave\u2019s RWA market and institutional services</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>AAVE ETP, exchange traded product of $AAVE</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Upon approval of this proposal, the DAO would also receive revenue from the swap integration on <a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a>, which currently generates approximately $10 million in annualized revenue.

Additionally, Aave Labs retains the discretion to redirect a portion of product inflows, such as vault yields, directly into user incentives. Competing for users requires the ability to deploy capital quickly toward growth without waiting for a governance cycle. In these instances, Aave Labs will disclose additional user incentives spending in our quarterly updates.</p>\n<p>With proper execution, the product layer can be an additional source of revenue for the DAO treasury. Combined with protocol fees, the DAO can fund its own growth, security, and development from a diversified revenue stream.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61633-expanding-revenue-through-aave-v4-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-expanding-revenue-through-aave-v4-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Expanding Revenue Through Aave V4</h3>\n<p>The product layer is one part of the path to increasing the DAO\u2019s annual revenue. The protocol layer, powered by Aave V4, is the other. Aave V3 already generates over $100 million in annualized revenue. <strong>Aave V4 expands on V3 with new monetization features that allow the protocol to capture more value from the risk it underwrites.</strong></p>\n<p>V4\u2019s architecture also unlocks revenue streams that are not easily possible in previous Aave versions.

Adding new features to V3 requires modifying core protocol logic, which involves extensive audits and significant coordination overhead. <strong>Meanwhile V4\u2019s architecture allows new functionality to be added through Spokes without touching the core, making experimentation cheaper, faster, and safer.</strong></p>\n<p>Importantly, anything V3 does can be recreated on V4, but not vice versa. <strong>V4 is a strict superset of V3\u2019s capabilities, meaning no functionality is lost in the upgrade.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>V4\u2019s architecture expands the range of revenue models the protocol can support, which is why governance analysis considers higher-scale revenue scenarios when planning long-term operations.</strong> To capture the opportunities outlined above, Aave Labs and the rest of the DAO\u2019s service providers should coordinate development efforts around V4. This means prioritizing V4 Spoke development, aligning roadmaps, and shifting new feature work away from V3. Notably, V4 is already live on testnet, has completed an open security contest, and has its first <a href=\"https://github.com/trailofbits/publications/blob/master/reviews/2026-02-aave-v4-securityreview.pdf\">public audit</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>The DAO is being asked to agree on this strategic direction and a separate proposal will follow for V4 protocol activation, the launch setup, etc.</strong></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61633-v3-maintenance-plan-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-v3-maintenance-plan-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>V3 Maintenance Plan</h3>\n<p>That said, <strong>V3 should not be shut down hastily or haphazardly.</strong> V3 is stable, mature, and battle-tested. There is no need for a rushed, or forced, migration, and the transition should happen in three phases:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Active Development (Current). V3 remains the primary production system, with security patches, parameter updates, and critical maintenance continuing as normal. It also makes sense to pause any new features for V3 if this framework is passed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stable Maintenance (Upon V4 Launch). V4 becomes the primary technology layer for expansion and innovation. V3 documentation, tooling, and access points remain fully supported, and users migrate at their own pace.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Legacy Support (8-12 Months After V4 Launch). Once V4 is mature, V3 parameters should be gradually adjusted to encourage migration, following the same approach used in past version transitions. V3 remains open indefinitely for withdrawals, with governance stepping in only for critical security issues.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>If the DAO ratifies this strategic direction, coordination among service providers will be important for efficient execution.</strong> Service providers funded by the DAO can align their work with this direction to maintain Aave\u2019s competitive position. Those who prefer to focus on different priorities can adjust their scope accordingly.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61633-aave-brand-governance-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-aave-brand-governance-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Aave Brand Governance</h2>\n<p>The Aave brand is one of the protocol\u2019s most important assets, built over years of technical excellence, security track record, and community trust. Protecting it is in the best interest of the DAO, token holders, and the broader ecosystem.</p>\n<p><strong>Today, Aave Labs is the exclusive legal owner of the Aave trademarks and has been solely responsible for holding, defending, and enforcing them.</strong> Because the DAO is not a legal entity, it cannot directly hold or defend trademarks. As a result, trademark stewardship has necessarily sat within Aave Labs.</p>\n<p><strong>For the past seven years, Aave Labs has carried this operational burden, and the work is hands-on, expensive, and necessary.</strong> <strong>Trademarks that are not actively and consistently defended can be weakened or lost</strong>, reducing the ability to control how a mark is used in commerce and increasing the risk of misuse or confusion.</p>\n<p>At the same time, there are understandable concerns around concentrating long-term control of such a critical asset within a single operating entity, particularly as the DAO continues to mature. <strong>To address this, and subject to DAO approval, Aave Labs proposes the creation of a Foundation that would assume responsibility for holding and stewarding the Aave trademarks going forward.</strong> The Foundation would be mandated to protect the brand, license it to approved entities, address unauthorized use, and operate in alignment with DAO-approved parameters.</p>\n<p>The details regarding the structure, governance, and execution of this Foundation, including any transfer or licensing of trademark rights, as well as proposed approaches to V4 codebase licensing, will be presented to the DAO in a follow-up proposal.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61633-aave-market-access-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-aave-market-access-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>$AAVE Market Access</h2>\n<p>To go beyond the product/protocol layer and expand market access to $AAVE, <strong>Aave Labs will support partners to launch regulated, traditional market products referencing $AAVE as the underlying asset</strong>.

Historically, the ecosystem\u2019s direction of travel (via AIP-1) was to use fees generated by Aave-branded products, such as <a href=\"http://aave.com\">aave.com</a> and other product surfaces, to cover Aave Labs\u2019 product development, marketing, legal, and operational costs, while the DAO funded direct protocol version development carried out by Aave Labs.</p>\n<p>Under the proposed operational framework, all fees from Aave-branded products would go to the DAO treasury rather than supporting Aave Labs\u2019 operations and product development. In this configuration, the responsibility for funding Aave Labs\u2019 activities would shift correspondingly to the DAO.</p>\n<p>Aave Labs requests $25 million in stablecoins, 75,000 AAVE, with additional growth and development grants payable upon specific product launches. The funding would be structured as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Primary Grant:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>$5 million paid upfront upon approval of the proposal and $20 million streamed over the course of the year.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>75,000 AAVE delivered upon approval of the proposal, unlocking linearly monthly over a 2 year period</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Growth/Development Grants:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>$5,000,000 for Aave App launch, with funds used for user acquisition, marketing, and ongoing development</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$5,000,000 for Aave Pro launch, with funds used for user acquisition, marketing, and ongoing development</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$5,000,000 for Aave Card launch, with funds used for user acquisition, marketing, and ongoing development</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$2,500,000 for Aave Kit launch, with funds used for maintenance and marketing</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: For clarity, all funds will be spent on Aave-related efforts.</em></p>\n<p>Growth and development grants are released upon delivery and streamed over a period of six months, with governance confirming completion before funds are disbursed. They cover the cost of bringing each product to market, from engineering through go-to-market.</p>\n<p>Companies entering DeFi are well-capitalized and spending aggressively on product and distribution. To succeed in the market, Aave needs to invest at a similar scale. This commitment allows for long-term planning, aggressive hiring, and sustained investment in product and go-to-market without the friction of annual budget cycles.</p>\n<p>The funding requested is a significant expansion of scope beyond historical funding. To date, Aave Labs has largely self-funded the cost of building and scaling the product layer, seeking DAO support mainly for core protocol development and focused marketing. This proposal secures the investment needed to stay competitive and continue innovating over the next decade. Growing Aave and growing it to the scale of other TradFi alternatives requires stable, predictable funding so contributors can plan, hire, and execute at the standard of a global financial platform.</p>\n<p>Altogether, these funds are covering the following costs:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Continued protocol development (V4 improvements, Spokes, core infrastructure, research, and development)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product engineering across Aave Pro, Aave App, Aave Kit, and other products</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Product go-to-market, user acquisition, marketing (e.g. social media/SEO/content) and growth</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Business development</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Labs invests heavily in partnering with the largest institutional and fintech names to integrate with Aave.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Aave Horizon asset onboarding and driving TVL/borrow growth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ongoing 360\u00b0 resource provision for institutional integrators, including technical, InfoSec and operational support.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Application security</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Aave Labs runs an extensive monitoring program, and very heavy enterprise fees to social media platforms, to protect the Aave brand.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Events, which historically Aave Labs has already run with funding from the DAO (e.g. rAAVE, DeFi Day)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With this capital, Aave Labs can build with the runway needed to succeed on the items outlined above. It would also reflect the DAO\u2019s decision to fund the level of execution required to support protocol operations at increased scale, should governance determine that expansion is warranted.</p>\n<p>In order to be as effective as possible, Aave Labs would retain autonomy over product strategy and operations. Building competitive products requires the ability to move quickly, make decisions without committee approval, and iterate based on market feedback. We suggest the same for other Service Providers who might choose to operate under this framework.</p>\n<p>The grants outlined above are for one year and would need to be revisited, if approved, 12 months after the proposal is decided on.</p>\n<p>In line with existing DAO practices, oversight of this work is exercised through governance. Aave Labs will provide regular transparency into its activities, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Quarterly updates on progress against funded initiatives, key metrics, and use of DAO-authorized resources</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ongoing updates on active workstreams and prioritization decisions</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Continued open and responsive communication with the DAO through established governance channels</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61633-h-4-next-steps-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-h-4-next-steps-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4. Next Steps</h2>\n<p>Aave remains early in its journey. What exists today is a base layer, while the real scale of adoption lies ahead as global finance moves onchain. DeFi is still quite small in the grand scheme of things. And over the coming decades, trillions of dollars in assets will migrate onto open rails. In that world, Aave can become the core infrastructure for global finance.</p>\n<p>Since 2017, the focus has been on disciplined execution at the frontier, and that conviction has only strengthened. The next phase of growth, fueled by innovation, and institutional adoption will be led by Aave. With sustained commitment and effective execution, the protocol can support significantly greater scale over time and continue establishing itself as core liquidity infrastructure for the onchain economy.</p>\n<p>This proposal seeks to establish a framework for Aave\u2019s next decade. Upon approval, it would reaffirm Aave Labs\u2019 alignment with the DAO by directing all Aave-branded product revenue to the DAO treasury. It asks for the ratification of V4 as the technical foundation for this growth and for the funding to execute this vision. This framework\u2019s objective is to position the Aave Protocol as a core piece of global financial infrastructure, with the value it creates directed to the Aave DAO to fund its continued development and success.</p>\n<p>In accordance with Aave governance processes, this proposal is intended as an initial Temp Check to gather community feedback on the strategic direction outlined above. Any  commitments, structural changes, or funding allocations would proceed through the appropriate stages of discussion, refinement, and governance proposal stages prior to implementation.</p>\n<p>If the Temp Check is successful and the community supports this proposal, we will move forward with a formal ARFC submission.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-disclaimer-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-disclaimer-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclaimer</h1>\n<p>Historically, Aave Labs has self-funded its endeavors. Due to the nature of the proposal, Aave Labs would receive funding from the DAO in exchange for Aave Labs\u2019 revenue going to the DAO if passed. No third parties co-authored this proposal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-copyright-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-copyright-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Copyright</h1>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived under <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\">Creative Commons Zero (CC0)</a>.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61633-faq-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61633-faq-16\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>FAQ</h1>\n<p><strong>1. Why are so many significant items grouped into a single proposal? Shouldn\u2019t these be separate votes?</strong></p>\n<p>This proposal presents a single, cohesive strategy. The components are interconnected and depend on each other for success. For example, aligning on V4 as the core technical foundation informs how development efforts are prioritized, while the proposed funding framework supports coordinated execution across protocol and product workstreams. Voting on these items separately could result in a fragmented and unworkable plan. Approving the strategy without the technology, or the technology without the funding to build it, would be inefficient. This proposal is a complete strategic package, and voting on it as a whole ensures the DAO is aligned on a single, comprehensive path forward.</p>\n<p><strong>2. The funding request is substantial. Why does Aave Labs need this budget?</strong></p>\n<p>The requested budget reflects a deliberate shift in operating model rather than an incremental extension of past funding. Historically, Aave Labs subsidized a broad range of activities and requested DAO support primarily for direct protocol development and focused marketing. Under this framework, the DAO is choosing to fund a wider operational scope directly, including product engineering, go-to-market execution, product relevant legal and compliance work, and business development. This budget is intended to support long-term planning and execution at scale and to enable stable resourcing and sustained focus. It reflects a governance decision about how the DAO wishes to resource protocol-adjacent work as Aave engages more directly with an evolving and increasingly competitive market landscape.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Why should the DAO fund Aave Labs now if it has been self-funded for so long?</strong></p>\n<p>By directing 100% of revenue to the DAO, Aave Labs will not be able to self-fund going forward. Without the ability to earn or raise revenue, there is no way to cover the costs across product development, business development, and other operational functions Aave Labs has historically funded. Without funding to continue this work these functions would stop.</p>\n<p><strong>4. Is this funding request annual?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes. Aave Labs will submit an annual budget proposal to the DAO for the work it performs. Each year\u2019s budget requires a separate governance vote, giving the DAO ongoing oversight of how funds are allocated.</p>\n<p><strong>5. What does \u201cautonomy\u201d mean in this proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>The proposal requests autonomy over certain operational and product strategy decisions. Building competitive products requires the ability to move quickly and iterate based on market feedback, which is difficult if every decision requires a vote. Accountability is central to this arrangement. Aave Labs commits to providing quarterly reports on progress, frequent updates on development, and continued open communication with the DAO. The DAO retains ultimate oversight through its control of the treasury and Aave Labs\u2019 funding stream. If Aave Labs does not meet its commitments or perform effectively, the DAO can choose not to continue contributing to this budget.</p>\n<p><strong>6. What does ratifying V4 mean in this proposal?</strong></p>\n<p>This vote asks the DAO to agree on a strategic direction. Ratifying V4 in this proposal means committing to it as the core technical foundation for future development. It signals to all service providers that V4 is the priority, allowing them to align their roadmaps and development efforts. This coordination is necessary to build the features that will achieve the proposal\u2019s goals. The subsequent vote to activate the V4 protocol will be a purely technical one, focused on the readiness of the code, launch parameters, etc.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Why is there compensation tied to milestones?</strong></p>\n<p>Launching and scaling products involves costs beyond core development work. This includes go-to-market execution, partnership development, and ongoing operational support around the time a product is introduced. The milestone-based payments are intended to support these activities at key delivery points, aligning resourcing with product rollout. As all revenue from these products flows to the DAO, funding this work supports execution that directly contributes to the protocol\u2019s operational sustainability.</p>\n<p><strong>8. How does this framework impact other Service Providers working with the Aave DAO?</strong></p>\n<p>If the DAO ratifies this proposal, coordination among service providers will be important for efficient execution. Service providers funded by the DAO can align their work with this direction to maintain Aave\u2019s competitive position. Those who prefer to focus on different priorities can propose adjusting their scope accordingly. Additionally, the increased surface area for revenue generation established by this proposal creates a framework that other service providers can consider for their own work with the DAO.</p>\n            <p><small>73 posts - 41 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/temp-check-aave-will-win-framework/24055\">Read full topic</a></p>\n          ",

These events constituted the first real stress test of the Slope2 Risk Oracle since its implementation. LlamaRisk tracked on-chain IRM parameter updates alongside actual borrow rates and derived utilization, discovering that the oracle\u2019s behavior diverged from its published specification in several material ways: the slope2 parameter dropped <em>below</em> its published floor during active stress, the oracle\u2019s first response to a kink breach was a reduction rather than an escalation, and multi-day periods passed with no parameter updates while utilization sat well above the kink.</p>\n<p>This report examines what drove the disruption, how the oracle appears to have failed to respond, and where the response diverged from the behavior described in the published <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-automation-of-the-slope2-parameter-via-risk-oracles/22919\">ARFC</a> and <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-risk-stewards-slope2-parameter-adjustments-for-risk-oracle-deployment/23192\">Risk Stewards specification</a>. Each finding is cross-referenced against specific governance claims, and its practical consequences for depositors and the protocol\u2019s liquidity buffer are detailed.</p>\n<p>Based on these findings, we outline a concrete set of recommendations in the Proposed Path Forward below \u2014 including a request for <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/chaoslabs\">@ChaosLabs</a> to publish a full post-mortem with deployed parameter values, an explanation of the floor breach, and a broader commitment to the transparency the DAO requires to govern delegated rate-setting mechanisms.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61811-specified-oracle-behavior-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61811-specified-oracle-behavior-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Specified Oracle Behavior</h2>\n<p>The Slope2 Risk Oracle mechanism is described in two governance publications: the original <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-automation-of-the-slope2-parameter-via-risk-oracles/22919\">ARFC on slope2 automation</a> (passed via Snapshot roughly six months ago) and a follow-up <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-risk-stewards-slope2-parameter-adjustments-for-risk-oracle-deployment/23192\">Risk Stewards post</a> specifying the initial parameter values for each reserve.</p>\n<p>The core idea is straightforward. The standard Aave interest rate model uses a piecewise-linear curve with a \u201ckink\u201d at optimal utilization <span class=\"math\">u_k</span>. Below the kink, borrowing cost rises gently along slope1. Above the kink, a steeper slope2 kicks in to penalize excess utilization and incentivize repayment. Historically, slope2 was a static governance parameter \u2014 for WETH on Ethereum Core, it was set at 20%.</p>\n<p>The oracle replaces this static value with a dynamic one. The ARFC describes three clearly defined phases:</p>\n<p><strong>1. The \u201cInitial Grace Phase\u201d</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cwhen utilization crosses the kink, the interest rate increases gradually via a parameterized slope above the kink (<span class=\"math\">s_2</span>) in accordance with a minimum viable deterrent.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The post-kink slope evolves as <span class=\"math\">s_{2,t+1} = s_{2,t} \\cdot \\exp(k \\cdot \\phi_t \\cdot \\Delta t)</span>, where <span class=\"math\">k</span> is the growth coefficient and <span class=\"math\">\\phi_t = \\left(\\frac{u_t - u_k}{1 - u_k}\\right)^+</span> is the normalized overshoot. The ARFC states this \u201cgentle escalation signals borrowers to unwind positions orderly without inducing panic or simultaneous exits.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>2. The \u201cEscalation Phase\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>The phase where \u201cslope growth compounds multiplicatively and exponentially. The longer the stress persists, the more expensive it becomes to stay levered.\u201d The ARFC requires that \u201cfor all <span class=\"math\">u &gt; u_k</span>, the incremental cost of remaining levered must increase monotonically with both the magnitude of excess utilization and the duration spent above the kink.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>3. The \u201cDecay Phase\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>The ARFC states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cOnce utilization falls below the kink, the elevated slope decays exponentially on a predictable half-life. Borrowers who remain can re-enter at lower rates without facing a sharp reset. Governance does not need to flip switches; decay is automatic.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The decay follows <span class=\"math\">s_{2,t+1} = s_{2,t} \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta t)</span>.</p>\n<p>Throughout all phases, the ARFC is explicit about mechanical boundedness. Under the heading \u201cBoundedness: Hard Caps, Credible Floors,\u201d the ARFC specifies that rate bounds \u201care enforced mechanically, not heuristically\u201d and that \u201ca non-trivial floor prevents the resurgence of recursive carry trades at negligible cost once stress subsides.\u201d The value of <span class=\"math\">s_2</span> is described as \u201calways clamped within predefined limits <span class=\"math\">[s_{\\min}, s_{\\max}]</span>.\u201d</p>\n<p>For WETH on Ethereum Core specifically, the Risk Stewards post set the recommended slope2 at 8%, down from the previous static value of 20%. The post explained that \u201cthe specification initially sets slope2 to its minimum value in each market, ensuring alignment with the parameterized algorithm of the respective reserve\u201d \u2014 in other words, 8% is <span class=\"math\">s_{\\min}</span>, the floor from which the oracle would escalate dynamically. The AGRS framework was configured to \u201callow a maximum absolute change of 4% every 8 hours.\u201d</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61811-observed-oracle-behavior-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61811-observed-oracle-behavior-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Observed Oracle Behavior</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/16fc4f82d912d1bafa060af5694f374aa8bcb5fb.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/3hl4N7W3L5rAbkWgBVd5FRiwFFF.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/1/16fc4f82d912d1bafa060af5694f374aa8bcb5fb_2_2000x982.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"3hl4N7W3L5rAbkWgBVd5FRiwFFF\" width=\"2000\" height=\"982\" srcset=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/1/16fc4f82d912d1bafa060af5694f374aa8bcb5fb_2_2000x982.png, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/optimized/2X/1/16fc4f82d912d1bafa060af5694f374aa8bcb5fb_2_3000x1473.png 1.5x, https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/16fc4f82d912d1bafa060af5694f374aa8bcb5fb.png 2x\" data-dominant-color=\"FAF9FA\"></a></div><br>\nSource: <a href=\"https://dune.com/queries/6699430/10547962\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">Dune Analytics</a>, February 17, 2026<p></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61811-the-baseline-feb-15-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61811-the-baseline-feb-15-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>The baseline (Feb 1\u20135)</h3>\n<p>Through the first five days of February, everything behaved as expected.

These events constituted the first real stress test of the Slope2 Risk Oracle since its implementation. LlamaRisk tracked on-chain IRM parameter updates alongside actual borrow rates and derived utilization, discovering that the oracle\u2019s behavior diverged from its published specification in several material ways: the slope2 parameter dropped <em>below</em> its published floor during active stress, the oracle\u2019s first response to a kink breach was a reduction rather than an escalation, and multi-day periods passed with no parameter updates while utilization sat well above the kink.</p>\n<p>This report examines what drove the disruption, how the oracle appears to have failed to respond, and where the response diverged from the behavior described in the published <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-automation-of-the-slope2-parameter-via-risk-oracles/22919\">ARFC</a> and <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-risk-stewards-slope2-parameter-adjustments-for-risk-oracle-deployment/23192\">Risk Stewards specification</a>. Each finding is cross-referenced against specific governance claims, and its practical consequences for depositors and the protocol\u2019s liquidity buffer are detailed.</p>\n<p>Based on these findings, we outline a concrete set of recommendations in the Proposed Path Forward below \u2014 including a request for <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/chaoslabs\">@ChaosLabs</a> to publish a full post-mortem with deployed parameter values, an explanation of the floor breach, and a broader commitment to the transparency the DAO requires to govern delegated rate-setting mechanisms.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61811-specified-oracle-behavior-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61811-specified-oracle-behavior-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Specified Oracle Behavior</h2>\n<p>The Slope2 Risk Oracle mechanism is described in two governance publications: the original <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-automation-of-the-slope2-parameter-via-risk-oracles/22919\">ARFC on slope2 automation</a> (passed via Snapshot roughly six months ago) and a follow-up <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-risk-stewards-slope2-parameter-adjustments-for-risk-oracle-deployment/23192\">Risk Stewards post</a> specifying the initial parameter values for each reserve.</p>\n<p>The core idea is straightforward. The standard Aave interest rate model uses a piecewise-linear curve with a \u201ckink\u201d at optimal utilization <span class=\"math\">u_k</span>. Below the kink, borrowing cost rises gently along slope1. Above the kink, a steeper slope2 kicks in to penalize excess utilization and incentivize repayment. Historically, slope2 was a static governance parameter \u2014 for WETH on Ethereum Core, it was set at 20%.</p>\n<p>The oracle replaces this static value with a dynamic one. The ARFC describes three clearly defined phases:</p>\n<p><strong>1. The \u201cInitial Grace Phase\u201d</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cwhen utilization crosses the kink, the interest rate increases gradually via a parameterized slope above the kink (<span class=\"math\">s_2</span>) in accordance with a minimum viable deterrent.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The post-kink slope evolves as <span class=\"math\">s_{2,t+1} = s_{2,t} \\cdot \\exp(k \\cdot \\phi_t \\cdot \\Delta t)</span>, where <span class=\"math\">k</span> is the growth coefficient and <span class=\"math\">\\phi_t = \\left(\\frac{u_t - u_k}{1 - u_k}\\right)^+</span> is the normalized overshoot. The ARFC states this \u201cgentle escalation signals borrowers to unwind positions orderly without inducing panic or simultaneous exits.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>2. The \u201cEscalation Phase\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>The phase where \u201cslope growth compounds multiplicatively and exponentially. The longer the stress persists, the more expensive it becomes to stay levered.\u201d The ARFC requires that \u201cfor all <span class=\"math\">u &gt; u_k</span>, the incremental cost of remaining levered must increase monotonically with both the magnitude of excess utilization and the duration spent above the kink.\u201d</p>\n<p><strong>3. The \u201cDecay Phase\u201d</strong></p>\n<p>The ARFC states:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cOnce utilization falls below the kink, the elevated slope decays exponentially on a predictable half-life. Borrowers who remain can re-enter at lower rates without facing a sharp reset. Governance does not need to flip switches; decay is automatic.\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The decay follows <span class=\"math\">s_{2,t+1} = s_{2,t} \\cdot \\exp(-\\lambda \\cdot \\Delta t)</span>.</p>\n<p>Throughout all phases, the ARFC is explicit about mechanical boundedness.

The oracle\u2019s peak slope2 of 9.75% remained well below the previous 20% static value, and its trough of 6.5% fell beneath its own published floor. At the time of the largest supply shock in the period, the maximum deterrent on the rate curve stood at 9.18%, compared to 22.45% under the prior regime. The result was that utilization shocks appear to have persisted longer than they would have under the previous configuration.</p>\n<p>We recommend the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Post-mortem disclosure:</strong> <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/chaoslabs\">@ChaosLabs</a> to publish a post-mortem covering the February WETH events, disclosing the exact parameter values (<span class=\"math\">k</span>, <span class=\"math\">\\lambda</span>, <span class=\"math\">s_{\\min}</span>, <span class=\"math\">s_{\\max}</span>) in effect throughout the period, any manual interventions or parameter overrides that occurred, and the root cause of the floor breach and the anomalous initial drop from 8.0% to 6.5%.</li>\n<li><strong>Public parameter registry:</strong> A public registry of the internal oracle parameters for each covered reserve, updated whenever they change, so that the community can independently verify that deployed values match approved specifications.  Accordingly, this will allow to transparently re-evaluate the model and parameters in order to more closely reflect the market behavior and tune the range of expected actions.</li>\n<li><strong>AGRS interaction analysis:</strong> A formal evaluation of the interaction between the AGRS rate-limiting framework (\u201cmaximum absolute change of 4% every 8 hours\u201d) and the oracle\u2019s continuous-compounding design. A mechanism whose specification assumes minute-by-minute compounding cannot deliver its promised behavior if constrained to infrequent, irregularly timed step changes. The February events suggest this interaction may be the binding constraint on response speed.</li>\n<li><strong>Effective range reassessment:</strong> An evaluation of whether the oracle\u2019s observed operating range of 6.5%\u20139.75% is adequate for a market where utilization spikes to 99.85%, as initially flagged by LlamaRisk in our <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/chaos-labs-risk-stewards-slope2-parameter-adjustments-for-risk-oracle-deployment/23192/2\">response to the Risk Stewards deployment post</a>. The gap between the oracle\u2019s maximum deterrent (9.18%) and the prior regime\u2019s (22.45%) should be explicitly justified or corrected.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The DAO\u2019s approval of this mechanism rested on specific mathematical properties \u2014 mechanical clamping, autonomous exponential decay, continuous compounding growth \u2014 and the ARFC itself positioned \u201ccalibratability\u201d and \u201creproducibility\u201d as core design goals. At present, neither the community nor LlamaRisk has the means to independently confirm whether the deployed configuration reflects the approved specification. The events of February 2026 demonstrate that delegating rate-setting authority to an off-chain oracle requires a commensurate commitment to transparency: the DAO cannot meaningfully govern a mechanism whose internal parameters are not publicly observable, whose update logic is not independently verifiable, and whose behavior during stress diverges from its specification without explanation.
