Within just 30 minutes, Bitcoin\u2019s price plunged more than 12%, dropping from $116,500 to $102,700. Ether saw an even steeper decline of around 20%, and many other assets lost over 50\u201360% of their value within 10-minute intervals. This sudden market disruption sparked a wave of liquidation cascades across both DeFi and CeFi platforms.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/e60732a1359706ea3fe0feee5bcd875d099a2cd4.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/wOVeQ63vQS5VqJIns0yL9XtA5fe.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/e60732a1359706ea3fe0feee5bcd875d099a2cd4.jpeg\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"wOVeQ63vQS5VqJIns0yL9XtA5fe\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1201\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>During this period, we observed significant irregularities in oracle price feed behavior. Several assets exhibited extreme levels of volatility, introducing heightened risk to the protocol. Despite these unfavorable conditions, Aave remained resilient and maintained operational integrity throughout the market turbulence, avoiding critical failures or substantial bad debt.</p>\n<p>In this analysis, we aim to evaluate the risks associated with these abnormal oracle behaviors and propose mitigation measures. Specifically, we recommend disabling the borrowability of a set of assets in order to reduce the protocol\u2019s risk profile during periods of extreme volatility and stressed market conditions. Additionally, given the extreme levels of volatility for the covered assets, combined with the significant lack of revenue generated by their usage as collateral assets, we recommend setting their LTV to 0 and progressively deprecating their collateral status.</p>\n<p>While Aave has been only minimally affected by these events, implementing these controls is essential to preserve the protocol\u2019s stability and safeguard against future periods of elevated volatility risk.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59282-oracle-updates-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59282-oracle-updates-2\"></a>Oracle Updates</h2>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/1323ceacf1b97294449747c1965b6078b05f693d.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/2JjMU4Jx9DDvDBGMKogxMtm0zqB.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image (1)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/1323ceacf1b97294449747c1965b6078b05f693d.jpeg\" alt=\"image (1)\" data-base62-sha1=\"2JjMU4Jx9DDvDBGMKogxMtm0zqB\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1201\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The number of unique assets that registered a price update exceeding \u00b115% amounted to 16 across 7 distinct instances. This distribution of updates signals that the anomalies were not isolated events, but rather systemic. Some examples are:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th><strong>Instance</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Asset</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Single Round_id Price Deviation</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Optimism</td>\n<td>AAVE</td>\n<td>62%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethereum</td>\n<td>AAVE</td>\n<td>41%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Sonic</td>\n<td>wS</td>\n<td>-40%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Arbitrum</td>\n<td>ARB</td>\n<td>-36%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ethereum</td>\n<td>CRV</td>\n<td>-33%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Such widespread oracle volatility presents protocol and systemic risks, as even short-lived pricing discrepancies can open arbitrage windows capable of draining liquidity or creating bad debt within lending markets.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59282-theoretical-framework-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59282-theoretical-framework-3\"></a>Theoretical Framework</h2>\n<p>Periods of extreme volatility, particularly during sharp market downturns, can result in substantial dislocations between centralized exchange and on-chain prices. Such divergences often emerge when market liquidity becomes fragmented and price discovery across venues fails to synchronize. Under these conditions, protocols relying on siloed oracle price feeds are exposed to heightened systemic risk, as the reported prices may temporarily deviate from market prices on other venues, causing the protocols to accrue deficits.</p>\n<p>When the oracle primarily references CEX prices while on-chain prices have not yet stabilized, substantial mispricing may arise. Suppose the protocol prices an asset X at <em><strong>PoX</strong></em> (the oracle price), while a DEX venue reflects a higher price ( <em><strong>PdX</strong></em> ) such that <em><strong>PdX</strong></em> &gt; <em><strong>PoX</strong></em> . A market participant could exploit this price differential if another asset, Y, can be used as collateral, and its  (1-liquidation threshold (LT)) is smaller than the price discrepancy.</p>\n<p>In practice, the participant could supply $1M worth of asset Y, borrow ( LT * $1M ) of asset X, and sell X on DEX venues at the higher market price. This arbitrage can be repeated multiple times until either oracle and market prices converge or the protocol\u2019s liquidity becomes constrained, thereby extracting value from the system and effectively transferring losses to the protocol.</p>\n<p>To eliminate this class of risk, it is essential to restrict borrowing for selected assets that exhibit high volatility or are prone to severe price dislocations under stressed conditions. Marking these assets unborrowable is a targeted risk control measure that protects the protocol from exploits.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59282-case-studies-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59282-case-studies-4\"></a>Case Studies</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59282-crvusdt-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59282-crvusdt-5\"></a>CRV/USDT</h3>\n<p>During the market crash, one notable instance of severe price dislocation occurred between the CRV/USD Chainlink oracle and the corresponding CRV/USDT Uniswap V3 pool, exposing Aave to a significant deficit.

To assess which assets present such risks, we examined price feed update patterns across multiple instances of Aave. Our reference threshold for assessing exploit potential is derived from the highest liquidation threshold (LT) on Aave\u2019s Ethereum Core instance, WETH, with an LT of 83%. For an exploit to be economically viable, the oracle must underprice an asset by more than (1 \u2013 LT), or approximately 17%. Therefore, our screening focused on assets that exhibited price updates exceeding \u00b115%, as these represent of potential vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/153fe4061126bb807a9a60c9a7e9ef95fc8dc8fb.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/31YUy9tBVrnC0WE5TPGbbVOBACv.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image (4)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/153fe4061126bb807a9a60c9a7e9ef95fc8dc8fb.jpeg\" alt=\"image (4)\" data-base62-sha1=\"31YUy9tBVrnC0WE5TPGbbVOBACv\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1189\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>As visualized in the chart above, 12 borrowable assets across various instances demonstrated abnormal oracle update behavior, characterized by large single-block percentage changes and delayed update times.

Specifically, we recommend disabling the borrowability of a set of assets in order to reduce the protocol\u2019s risk profile during periods of extreme volatility and stressed market conditions.

Such divergences often emerge when market liquidity becomes fragmented and price discovery across venues fails to synchronize. Under these conditions, protocols relying on siloed oracle price feeds are exposed to heightened systemic risk, as the reported prices may temporarily deviate from market prices on other venues, causing the protocols to accrue deficits.</p>\n<p>When the oracle primarily references CEX prices while on-chain prices have not yet stabilized, substantial mispricing may arise. Suppose the protocol prices an asset X at <em><strong>PoX</strong></em> (the oracle price), while a DEX venue reflects a higher price ( <em><strong>PdX</strong></em> ) such that <em><strong>PdX</strong></em> &gt; <em><strong>PoX</strong></em> . A market participant could exploit this price differential if another asset, Y, can be used as collateral, and its  (1-liquidation threshold (LT)) is smaller than the price discrepancy.</p>\n<p>In practice, the participant could supply $1M worth of asset Y, borrow ( LT * $1M ) of asset X, and sell X on DEX venues at the higher market price. This arbitrage can be repeated multiple times until either oracle and market prices converge or the protocol\u2019s liquidity becomes constrained, thereby extracting value from the system and effectively transferring losses to the protocol.</p>\n<p>To eliminate this class of risk, it is essential to restrict borrowing for selected assets that exhibit high volatility or are prone to severe price dislocations under stressed conditions. Marking these assets unborrowable is a targeted risk control measure that protects the protocol from exploits.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59282-case-studies-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59282-case-studies-4\"></a>Case Studies</h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59282-crvusdt-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59282-crvusdt-5\"></a>CRV/USDT</h3>\n<p>During the market crash, one notable instance of severe price dislocation occurred between the CRV/USD Chainlink oracle and the corresponding CRV/USDT Uniswap V3 pool, exposing Aave to a significant deficit.

Our reference threshold for assessing exploit potential is derived from the highest liquidation threshold (LT) on Aave\u2019s Ethereum Core instance, WETH, with an LT of 83%. For an exploit to be economically viable, the oracle must underprice an asset by more than (1 \u2013 LT), or approximately 17%. Therefore, our screening focused on assets that exhibited price updates exceeding \u00b115%, as these represent of potential vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/153fe4061126bb807a9a60c9a7e9ef95fc8dc8fb.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/31YUy9tBVrnC0WE5TPGbbVOBACv.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"image (4)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/1/153fe4061126bb807a9a60c9a7e9ef95fc8dc8fb.jpeg\" alt=\"image (4)\" data-base62-sha1=\"31YUy9tBVrnC0WE5TPGbbVOBACv\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1189\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>As visualized in the chart above, 12 borrowable assets across various instances demonstrated abnormal oracle update behavior, characterized by large single-block percentage changes and delayed update times.

The significant growth in USDC and USDT borrowing has rendered the initial coverage levels outdated. To align with current market conditions, the recommendation is to increase the target liquidity for USDT to 130 million and decrease the target for GHO to 8 million. In contrast, the targets for USDC and WETH will remain unchanged. This addresses the observed shifts in borrow activity and ensures coverage levels are appropriate for the current risk exposure.</p>\n<p>In addition to adjusting existing modules, we propose expanding Umbrella\u2019s scope to include three high-impact assets: wstETH, USDe, and WBTC. This expansion would bring assets accounting for 98.12% of total borrows under Umbrella\u2019s protection. In the medium term, the associated increase in annual emissions would be offset by the ongoing depreciation of legacy staking modules.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59183-introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59183-introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n<p>It has been four months since the launch of Umbrella, which has proven successful, with all existing modules reaching their target coverage levels. However, since the initial insurance caps were recommended, market dynamics have shifted, particularly for USDC and USDT; both have seen significant supply and borrow activity growth on the Aave V3 Core instance.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/50f48993c2ef7578ad5aaa6f58241c8d49af284c.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/bya7eipqQoeWQ89bShOs0tsGG3q.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/50f48993c2ef7578ad5aaa6f58241c8d49af284c.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"bya7eipqQoeWQ89bShOs0tsGG3q\" width=\"1184\" height=\"690\"></a></div><br>\n<em>Source: LlamaRisk, September 29, 2025</em><p></p>\n<p>Beyond these assets, others such as wstETH and USDe represent a substantial share of Aave\u2019s TVL, highlighting the need to expand Umbrella\u2019s coverage to include them.

Increased price volatility of ETH resulted in a shortage of WETH liquidity in secondary markets. At the same time, the long validator exit queue created a parallel shortage of LST/ETH liquidity on DEXs. This is particularly relevant since the two largest WETH borrowers, accounting for ~47% of WETH borrows, engage in LST/LRT looping strategies at low health factors of <a href=\"https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x9600a48ed0f931d0c422d574e3275a90d8b22745\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">1.02</a> and <a href=\"https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0xf0bb20865277abd641a307ece5ee04e79073416c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">1.06</a>.

The significant growth in USDC and USDT borrowing has rendered the initial coverage levels outdated. To align with current market conditions, the recommendation is to increase the target liquidity for USDT to 130 million and decrease the target for GHO to 8 million. In contrast, the targets for USDC and WETH will remain unchanged. This addresses the observed shifts in borrow activity and ensures coverage levels are appropriate for the current risk exposure.</p>\n<p>In addition to adjusting existing modules, we propose expanding Umbrella\u2019s scope to include three high-impact assets: wstETH, USDe, and WBTC. This expansion would bring assets accounting for 98.12% of total borrows under Umbrella\u2019s protection. In the medium term, the associated increase in annual emissions would be offset by the ongoing depreciation of legacy staking modules.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59183-introduction-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59183-introduction-2\"></a>Introduction</h2>\n<p>It has been four months since the launch of Umbrella, which has proven successful, with all existing modules reaching their target coverage levels.

In response to this demand, their respective caps were raised multiple times:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>USDC supply cap increased from $4.8B to $7.5B, and the borrow cap from $4.32B to $7B</li>\n<li>USDT supply cap rose from $5.25B to $9.5B, and borrow cap from $4.72B to $8.8B.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59183-adjusted-coverage-estimations-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59183-adjusted-coverage-estimations-5\"></a>Adjusted Coverage Estimations</h3>\n<p>Following the changes, new liquidity targets for each asset under Umbrella were determined using our <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-aave-umbrella-activation/21521/22\">VaR methodology</a>, which simulates extreme market stress using historical price data to generate synthetic shock scenarios. It models user liquidations under these shocks to estimate each asset\u2019s liquidation capacity (the maximum debt that can be liquidated profitably for liquidators). Based on the simulation run done on September 29, 2025, we present the liquidation capacity changes overlaid with the asset borrow cap changes:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Asset</th>\n<th>Liquidation Capacity Change</th>\n<th>Borrow Cap Change</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>USDC</td>\n<td>50,400,000 USDC <strong>\u2192</strong> 117,700,000 USDC</td>\n<td>4,320,000,000 USDC <strong>\u2192</strong> 7,000,000,000 USDC</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>USDT</td>\n<td>12,200,000 USDT <strong>\u2192</strong> 42,730,000 USDT</td>\n<td>4,720,000,000 USDT <strong>\u2192</strong> 8,800,000,000 USDT</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>WETH</td>\n<td>6,900 WETH <strong>\u2192</strong> 697 WETH</td>\n<td>2,700,000 WETH <strong>\u2192</strong> 2,900,000 WETH</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>GHO</td>\n<td>5,000,000 GHO <strong>\u2192</strong> 18,220,000 GHO</td>\n<td>180,000,000 GHO <strong>\u2192</strong> 180,000,000 GHO (unchanged)</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>Over the four months since the initial simulation run on May 15, 2025, the liquidation capacity for USDC, USDT, and GHO has increased substantially, while WETH capacity has declined. These shifts are primarily explained by changes in borrower distribution: when a larger share of debt is concentrated in a few large borrowers, liquidity capacity decreases as fewer liquidatable positions fall within the inlier set defined by the Interquartile Range (IRQ) method.</p>\n<p>In the case of WETH, the decline in liquidation capacity was further exacerbated by market conditions. Increased price volatility of ETH resulted in a shortage of WETH liquidity in secondary markets. At the same time, the long validator exit queue created a parallel shortage of LST/ETH liquidity on DEXs. This is particularly relevant since the two largest WETH borrowers, accounting for ~47% of WETH borrows, engage in LST/LRT looping strategies at low health factors of <a href=\"https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0x9600a48ed0f931d0c422d574e3275a90d8b22745\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">1.02</a> and <a href=\"https://community.chaoslabs.xyz/aave/risk/wallets/0xf0bb20865277abd641a307ece5ee04e79073416c\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">1.06</a>.

In contrast, WETH coverage has been maintained primarily through substantial deposits into its Safety Module. The main exception is USDT, where current borrow cap coverage has declined. Based on these observations, we recommend increasing USDT\u2019s target liquidity while reducing GHO\u2019s target liquidity by 33%, as its existing liquidity capacity is already sufficient. To accommodate the higher USDT target liquidity, we propose that the DAO adjust incentive emissions for the USDT Umbrella modules.</p>\n<p>With these changes, the maximal emissions would be increased by 920K aUSDT per year, partially offset by a reduction of 400K GHO per year in GHO module emissions. This adjustment would preserve the current APY ranges, maintain spend efficiency for the DAO, and ensure continued attraction of sufficient staked liquidity.</p>\n<p>No changes are recommended for the WETH module at this time, as its deposits remain comfortably above the target coverage level, and neither a target liquidity increase nor additional incentives are required to sustain participation.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59183-expansion-of-umbrella-modules-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59183-expansion-of-umbrella-modules-6\"></a>Expansion of Umbrella Modules</h2>\n<p>There are currently 32 assets on Aave V3 Core with non-zero borrow balances that are not yet included under Umbrella coverage.

As part of the next phase of Umbrella expansion, we propose adding wstETH, USDe, and WBTC to the coverage framework, while continuing to monitor the other emerging stablecoins for future inclusion.</p>\n<p>Following the addition of these three assets, the Umbrella Safety Module would encompass assets that collectively account for approximately 98.12% of total borrows on Aave V3 Core, equivalent to $20.9B in outstanding debt. After this expansion, only $390M in borrowings would remain outside Umbrella\u2019s scope.

Albeit, USDe exhibited zero shock deviation, suggesting stable pricing behavior even in stressed conditions. In contrast, wstETH showed the highest simulated price shock at -0.058%, which still represents a relatively mild drawdown. WBTC demonstrated greater resilience, with a smaller shock value of -0.04%, indicating stronger stability during market stress situations.</p>\n<p>To support the inclusion of these new assets into the Umbrella Safety Module, we estimate the following maximum annual emissions required to maintain sufficient risk-adjusted yield at target liquidity levels: 50 awstETH (~$255K), 773K aUSDe ($780K), and 0.5 aWBTC ($57K), targeting Umbrella APY of 0.55%, 1.76%, and 0.2% at target liquidity.

      "description": "\n            <p><strong>Title</strong>: [ARFC] Ethena USDe Risk Oracle and Automated Freeze Guardian<br>\n<strong>Author</strong>: LlamaRisk<br>\n<strong>Date</strong>: Friday, October 24th, 2025</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59468-summary-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-summary-1\"></a>Summary</h2>\n<p>This post outlines a proposal for an enhanced, risk-managed price oracle and automated freeze guardian for USDe and its derivatives on the Aave protocol. Recent market events have highlighted the importance of having resilient collateral pricing strategies to mitigate the solvency risk Aave takes on. Given these events, it is prudent to upgrade Aave\u2019s USDe pricing mechanism, which currently pegs USDe to the USDT market price.</p>\n<p>The proposed system creates a more resilient and proactive framework that protects Aave from solvency risk while shielding users from premature liquidations caused by transient market dislocations. This improvement is enabled by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/chainlink_labs\">@Chainlink_Labs</a>, whose battle-tested decentralized oracle network (DON) infrastructure already underpins numerous data and interoperability oracle services used by Aave (e.g., Price Feeds, Proof of Reserve, CCIP, LlamaGuard NAV).</p>\n<p>At this time, supply caps are set in Ethena-related assets such that Aave has up to $5.5B additional potential exposure to Ethena. To mitigate risks of this potential additional exposure, this trust-minimized system consists of two parts: 1) the dynamic, risk-managed pricing oracle, using the most representative pricing source in different situations, and 2) the protective action-taking mechanism, performing USDe-related reserve freezes if any of the specified risk signals indicate potential solvency stress. These components shield Aave from further harm while protecting current users, creating a more resilient and secure solution.</p>\n<p>A critical aspect of this architecture is that it introduces no additional trust assumptions. The entire solution will run on-chain with DAO-approved oversight and via the existing Chainlink infrastructure. LlamaRisk will have no privileged access controls and cannot make unilateral changes to the system\u2019s logic or parameters. This design ensures the system is both highly secure and fully auditable. Furthermore, introducing proactiveness into the system will improve Aave\u2019s resiliency and, therefore, can improve the collateral efficiency of Ethena\u2019s assets on Aave.</p>\n<p>This is an early-stage proposal to kick off discussion on fundamental upgrades to Aave\u2019s pricing strategies. We continue to collaborate with Ethena on suitable system stress indicators and parameterization of emergency response. Our highest priority is to ensure the continued stability of Aave markets and support its safe exposure to Ethena assets for the benefit of both protocols and their users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59468-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Aave currently prices USDe on par with the USDT price feed. This design was chosen deliberately to safeguard Aave users from the risk of unnecessary liquidations, while tying USDe\u2019s price to its most heavily weighted backing asset for hedging positions (i.e., USDT), and the largest stablecoin backing allocation. Given that USDe can experience temporary de-pegs driven by market sentiment or short-term liquidity constraints on secondary markets, a direct market-priced oracle could trigger liquidations that do not reflect USDe\u2019s actual backing. While this approach effectively protects borrowers, it transfers the solvency risk to the Aave protocol.</p>\n<p>In a fundamental backing-related USDe failure scenario, the on-par pricing would prevent necessary liquidations until the oracle is manually updated, potentially leading to an accumulation of bad debt, as outlined in <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-susde-and-usde-price-feed-update/20495\">extensive discussions</a> earlier this year. Protection from further exposure depends on a manual freeze initiated by the Guardian multisig. This method introduces inherent latency, as the process necessitates a coordinated human response for situational analysis, signature collection, and transaction execution. Nonetheless, this framework was chosen because Aave already bears most of Ethena\u2019s solvency risks.</p>\n<p>During the October 10th aggressive cryptocurrency market volatility events on centralized exchanges, most notably Binance, USDe\u2019s secondary market price experienced a significant, albeit temporary de-peg, moving the price down to $0.65 at the lowest point. However, it is crucial to note that Ethena\u2019s core redemption mechanism proved resilient despite this secondary market dislocation. The protocol handled a significant inflow of redemptions during this event and during the previous stressful event of the Bybit exploit, keeping the redemption flow completely functional and successfully processing more than a billion dollars of USDe redemptions without issue.</p>\n<p>While Aave avoided immediate issues from the de-peg on Binance by pricing USDe on par with USDT, the crypto community again raised concerns that this was not an optimal pricing method. In a real insolvency event, this approach would cause Aave to assume all of Ethena\u2019s solvency risk, as the protocol could be exploited as an exit venue for USDe holders. Such tail risks must be addressed proactively.</p>\n<p>Note: Chainlink USDe/USD price feed, which sources from multiple venues, did not deviate significantly during this localized de-peg, registering a minor 70 basis point deviation, in line with broader market pricing.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59468-why-is-exposure-limiting-important-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-why-is-exposure-limiting-important-3\"></a>Why is Exposure Limiting Important?</h3>\n<p>Aave currently prices USDe collateral using the Chainlink USDT/USD price feed. This pricing mechanism creates a critical dependency: in the event of a fundamental failure of Ethena\u2019s backing, USDe\u2019s market price could collapse, but the USDT/USD oracle used by Aave would remain stable at ~$1.00.

A more advanced system can be implemented to achieve both. We propose a new framework that separates the oracle\u2019s functions into two distinct components: a dynamic pricing system and a proactive action-taking system. The pricing system is designed to switch between different data sources based on real-time indicators of Ethena\u2019s health, ensuring the most appropriate price for USDe is used under various conditions. The action-taking system works in parallel as a circuit breaker, capable of freezing the USDe markets to protect Aave\u2019s solvency if severe stress signals are detected and avoid additional exposure. Together, these components create a comprehensive, responsive, prudent risk management framework.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59468-the-action-taking-system-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-the-action-taking-system-5\"></a>The Action-Taking System</h3>\n<p>The Action-Taking System is a proactive safety mechanism. This system is minimally invasive for existing users and, importantly, is not responsible for determining liquidation prices. It acts as an emergency circuit breaker to protect the protocol, freezing the USDe-priced reserves and implicitly limiting the incremental exposure to USDe\u2019s solvency.</p>\n<p>The circuit breaker is triggered by stress signals from any of the following four distinct categories, providing comprehensive, defense-in-depth monitoring. These categories are subject to change depending on viability:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Market Stress</strong>: Monitors the market prices of USDe and its backing stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDC) for signs of broad market de-pegging.</li>\n<li><strong>Redemption-System Stress</strong>: Tracks the on-chain health and operational capacity of Ethena\u2019s core mint and redeem functions.</li>\n<li><strong>Proof of Reserve (PoR) Stress</strong>: Verifies official reports on Ethena\u2019s collateralization to confirm that assets fully back the circulating supply.</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/561768da235f8533f66881afa4343735edd9312e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/chBdt6AAwcYVf7qXRwJyNdglKz4.png?dl=1\" title=\"Action Taking Mechanism\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/561768da235f8533f66881afa4343735edd9312e.png\" alt=\"Action Taking Mechanism\" data-base62-sha1=\"chBdt6AAwcYVf7qXRwJyNdglKz4\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The system acts on a single\u2011trigger basis: if one stress category fires, the system freezes all USDe\u2011priced reserves. Unfreezing happens only after signals normalize for a defined cool\u2011off period. The mechanism is automated through the Chainlink platform, inheriting the same trust and liveness properties as existing Chainlink price feeds.</p>\n<p>The first category is market stress, captured from Chainlink price feeds for the USDe backing stablecoins such as USDT, USDC (and PYUSD if the amount held in the backing is significant to exceed the current reserve fund size). Following the same rationale, stETH/ETH internal exchange rate (and other LSTs) should be included in the aggregation, due to Ethena\u2019s exposure to these LSTs as part of its hedging assets portfolio. If these prices trade below $0.99, the system interprets that as a broad, cross\u2011stable dislocation rather than a single\u2011venue artifact. Price weakness in the stablecoin complex tends to precede redemption pressure, so reacting here gives Aave time to contain risk before stress propagates into positions.</p>\n<p>The second category is redemption\u2011system stress, which monitors the health of Ethena\u2019s mint/redeem process directly on-chain. The mechanism monitors whether the redemption buffer is replenished to at least $2M within 50 blocks, and whether the redemption contract is paused. Any of these conditions suggests that operational liquidity is constrained or deliberately throttled. When redemptions cannot be served promptly, the safest course is to ensure Aave cannot be used as exit liquidity while Ethena stabilizes operations.</p>\n<p>The third category is the PoR reported by Ethena and verified by independent third parties, including LlamaRisk, Chaos Labs, and Chainlink. It accepts the PoR report as an authority on Ethena\u2019s solvency and will trigger action if collateralization &lt; 100% is reported. This is most likely a lagging indicator, given the infrequent PoR updates; however, it is the most direct insight available about the state of Ethena\u2019s reserves.</p>\n<p>Future upgrades to the Action Taking Mechanism can include hedging stress indicators that take perp exchange data, such as slippage, spot vs. perp spreads, and funding rates as proactive risk triggers. To minimize false positives, such trigger conditions shall involve extensive analysis and back testing by Aave risk providers working in collaboration with the Ethena team.</p>\n<p>When any category triggers, the system freezes USDe\u2011priced reserves across Aave. A freeze halts new borrows and disables new collateral enables on the affected assets, but existing positions continue to accrue interest and can be repaid or deleveraged normally. Liquidations can also happen during that time, facilitating exposure lowering. This design prevents Aave from becoming an exit venue during stress and caps incremental exposure without forcing liquidations purely due to transient signals.</p>\n<p>The scope of the freeze includes USDe itself and downstream assets priced from it, such as sUSDe and PT\u2011USDe, ensuring consistent behavior. After all triggered indicators clear (metrics back within thresholds), the mechanism waits for a cool\u2011off interval\u2014defined in blocks or minutes\u2014before automatically unfreezing; Guardians and governance retain override capability for exceptional cases.</p>\n<p>Because the circuit breaker only freezes new supply and borrows, and never changes collateral valuations, it does not create bad debt. It simply buys time for pricing to converge and for operations to normalize, allowing natural repayments and deleveraging to proceed. In effect, the mechanism mitigates Aave\u2019s exposure to USDe\u2011related insolvency risk, yet minimizes user disruption and preserves the protocol\u2019s openness once conditions stabilize. Our design, however, prioritizes stable protocol operation; therefore, we implement risk triggers that minimize instances of false positives.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59468-risk-managed-pricing-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-risk-managed-pricing-6\"></a>Risk-managed Pricing</h3>\n<p>The core of the new proposal is a dynamic pricing logic that evaluates a hierarchy of signals to determine the preferred USDe pricing method. The system is designed to be resilient, defaulting to the most reflective pricing sources as risk signals appear. The logic is illustrated in the following flow chart.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/e0078ca7db8ec2f7dc75bacb3af17fa33f94ceb4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vXR7VVC5CogiGzvhcP8yxB9ueGg.png?dl=1\" title=\"Risk Managed Feed\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/e0078ca7db8ec2f7dc75bacb3af17fa33f94ceb4.png\" alt=\"Risk Managed Feed\" data-base62-sha1=\"vXR7VVC5CogiGzvhcP8yxB9ueGg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The system operates as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It first checks Ethena\u2019s core operational health by verifying if redemptions are being processed promptly and the mint/redeem buffer has been replenished to at least $2M over the last 50* blocks (~10 minutes). Suppose the redemption buffer is not being replenished on time. In that case, it indicates a severe operational issue, and the system switches to a market-based pricing source, a time-weighted USDe/USD market price oracle.</li>\n<li>If redemptions are operational, the system verifies Ethena\u2019s Proof of Reserves (PoR) from the attestors - LlamaRisk, Chainlink, Chaos Labs &amp; HT Digital - to check if the system is fully collateralized. If collateralization is below 1, it signifies a direct risk to USDe\u2019s backing, and the system then defaults to a mechanism that defines USDe price as the latest USDe redemption rate returned in the Mint/Redeem contract. It is notable that due to the assumed staleness of Ethena\u2019s PoR (currently reported at a 7-day frequency), the indicated collateralization cannot be taken as an accurate measure of the exact USDe backing level, needing to source the USDe backing rate from the Mint/Redeem contract.</li>\n<li>If redemptions and collateralization are healthy, it performs a final check on the live redemption rate from Ethena\u2019s Mint/Redeem contract. If the rate is at or very near par, excluding the usual 10 bps redemption fee (&gt;= 0.999) and gas costs (which are included in the exchange rate calculation), the system is considered fully healthy. Due to the gas cost impact on the exchange rate, a redemption size threshold would be applied. In this state, the oracle can use the most accurate of several price sources, either the currently used Chainlink USDT/USD price or an aggregate market price measure of the stable assets backing USDe and denominating the perpetual hedging pairs.</li>\n<li>If the redemption rate is below this threshold, the oracle will use it as the price source, again applying a redemption size threshold. In cases where the initial checks on redemptions or PoR reported collateralization fail, the system switches to a time-weighted USDe/USD oracle price, which is designed to handle market stress gracefully, not switching to a potentially more aggressive market price of USDe at an instant, but doing it gradually.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: Ethena has been briefed on the overall operational flow, and we are actively working with their team to align on all trigger conditions and parameterization to ensure high reliability of the dual price feed and the incorporated risk indicators.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59468-time-based-usde-oracle-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-time-based-usde-oracle-7\"></a>Time-Based USDe Oracle</h3>\n<p>A key component of the stressed-condition response is the time-weighted oracle. This mechanism is designed to smooth out sudden, volatile price dislocations and protect the Aave protocol from the short-lived de-pegs observed historically. This is achieved using a specifically tuned exponential moving average (EMA) of the USDe/USD market price.</p>\n<p>Instead of instantly adopting the new, lower market price during a de-peg, this oracle gradually moves the price from 1 USD toward the Chainlink USDe/USD market price. The adjustment is based on a simple formula where the new price is a weighted average of the current oracle and live market prices. This creates an exponential slope that allows the oracle to catch up to a sustained de-peg quickly but dampens the immediate impact of flash crashes, giving the market time to stabilize and preventing unwarranted liquidations.</p>\n<p>Another effect of the gradual price move is making the positions liquidatable in increments, not aggressively at once. Based on our <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-susde-and-usde-price-feed-update/20495/7\">previous analysis</a>, sharp depegs were observed not to have the immediate DEX liquidity depth required to support successful liquidations.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59468-aggregate-market-price-based-on-backing-composition-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-aggregate-market-price-based-on-backing-composition-8\"></a>Aggregate Market Price Based on Backing Composition</h3>\n<p>Instead of relying on a single stablecoin (e.g., USDT) as a fallback reference, we propose an aggregate market\u2011price oracle constructed from the stable assets that back USDe or denominate the perpetual hedging pairs. The idea is straightforward: each constituent stablecoin or asset contributes to the reference price in proportion to its share of Ethena\u2019s effective exposure. If USDT accounts for 50% of the combined backing and hedge\u2011denomination footprint, it receives a 50% weight; if USDC accounts for 20%, it receives a 20% weight; and so on for PYUSD, DAI, or other constituents. If significant, stETH/ETH internal exchange rate (and other LSTs) should be included in the aggregation, due to Ethena\u2019s exposure to these LSTs as part of its hedging assets portfolio. The resulting index reflects the value of the collateral basket and the currency units in which hedge PnL accrues, producing a more accurate proxy for USDe\u2019s underlying economics than any stable.</p>\n<p>Weights would be sourced from Ethena\u2019s reported backing composition, which is already published and can be consumed programmatically. The oracle ingests this composition on a regular cadence (daily by default) and can refresh more frequently if Ethena provides interim updates during periods of rapid rebalancing. For operational reasons, however, frequent updates to the rebalancing may not be possible. Between updates, the index prices each constituent using its respective Chainlink USD feed, applying the most recent weight vector. This approach keeps the price reference aligned with the real-time backing and hedge denomination mix without introducing undue operational churn.</p>\n<p>Operationally, the aggregate index maintains the same trust assumptions as existing Chainlink feeds: constituent prices are read from Chainlink oracles, the weighting and aggregation are executed on a transparent contract, and all parameters and updates are emitted as on\u2011chain events. Governance and Guardians can set guardrails such as maximum per\u2011asset weights, minimum asset quality criteria, and failover behavior if a constituent feed is stale. This produces a robust, auditable fallback that tracks USDe\u2019s effective exposure across the stablecoin complex rather than relying on any single asset.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59468-analysis-takeaways-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-analysis-takeaways-9\"></a>Analysis &amp; Takeaways</h2>\n<p>Our analysis of the proposed USDe Risk Managed Oracle validates the design via historical data and simulations. The system\u2019s effectiveness is rooted in its use of verifiable, on-chain signals to inform its pricing and safety mechanisms.</p>\n<p>A primary signal for the action-taking and pricing modules is the status of Ethena\u2019s mint/redeem buffer. From a historical perspective, the contract shows a sole instance where the buffer was depleted, after which it was replenished within 98 blocks. Since that event, Ethena has adopted a more conservative management strategy, consistently maintaining a healthy buffer and even increasing its capitalization during periods of high redemption demand. This consistent operational performance is significant because a well-capitalized buffer ensures redemptions can be processed reliably and the value of USDe remains stable. This track record of stability validates using the buffer\u2019s replenishment status as a dependable input for our proposed system. A failure to meet the replenishment threshold, as defined in the proposal, would serve as a clear, data-driven indicator of potential stress, allowing the system to take pre-emptive protective measures.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b0cceb6b37d421cc82badb0f8ced8d7f960ec718.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pe34wItMTs73DuP7BjnjPqquOzC.png?dl=1\" title=\"Replenishment Periods\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b0cceb6b37d421cc82badb0f8ced8d7f960ec718.png\" alt=\"Replenishment Periods\" data-base62-sha1=\"pe34wItMTs73DuP7BjnjPqquOzC\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1114\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This operational integrity is also reflected in the on-chain redemption rates. The redemptions are serviced at a constant 1:1 rate, deducting a 10 basis point fee and gas costs, leading to consistent values around the $0.9990 level. The stability of this rate provides a reliable proxy for USDe\u2019s fundamental value, anchored directly to its backing assets rather than fluctuating secondary market sentiment. In scenarios where market prices become dislocated, this on-chain rate offers a stable valuation anchor in scenarios where market prices become dislocated, especially as the mint/redeem contract remains functional. The proposed oracle is designed to leverage this, incorporating an adjusted redemption rate as a pricing source under specific stress conditions. This ensures the system has a logical, economically grounded value to fall back on, preventing it from being immediately influenced by temporary market panic or pricing anomalies.</p>\n<p>Backtesting the proposed pricing feeds reveals further insights into its expected functioning. During a recent de-peg event, the observed spread between USDe and USDT widened notably. This was caused by a decrease in USDe\u2019s price and a simultaneous increase in USDT\u2019s price, driven by high demand for stablecoins during market-wide liquidations. This event illustrates the limitations of a single-asset peg for an asset like USDe, whose backing is composed of multiple stablecoins. The proposed system addresses this by incorporating an aggregate stablecoin feed designed to reflect the composition of USDe\u2019s backing more closely. By sourcing prices from a basket of assets (USDT, USDC, PYUSD) and LSTs\u2019 internal exchange rates, the feed\u2019s construction goes a step further: the weights of these assets would be dynamically adjusted based on Ethena\u2019s reported backing data. This approach creates a price benchmark representing USDe\u2019s actual collateral dependencies. Instead of enforcing a full correlation with a single asset like USDT, the oracle\u2019s price would inherently reflect the weighted value of its true backing. Consequently, should an issue arise with a single constituent stablecoin, its impact on USDe\u2019s valuation would be adequately weighted according to its share of the collateral, providing a more accurate risk assessment and a more resilient price feed than a simple peg to USDT.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9acfbd35eda33599efa073e9900f3865f50adc41.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/m5wBMDxabtZSoKYGt489vwkXANH.png?dl=1\" title=\"Prices &amp; Spread\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9acfbd35eda33599efa073e9900f3865f50adc41.png\" alt=\"Prices &amp; Spread\" data-base62-sha1=\"m5wBMDxabtZSoKYGt489vwkXANH\" width=\"1600\" height=\"768\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>A central element for managing market stress within the proposal is the mechanism for transitioning the oracle\u2019s price. A direct switch to a raw market price feed during volatility is suboptimal, as immediate price shocks on secondary markets are often more aggressive and rapid than any potential impairment to the underlying backing. To address this, the proposal utilizes a time-weighted price based on an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to serve as a controlled, gradual smoothing mechanism. Our backtesting confirms that an EMA with a low alpha parameter (in the 0.05 to 0.1 range) is most effective. By design, a low-alpha EMA gives more weight to its stable historical price than to the most recent, and potentially volatile, market update. This means that a sudden, sharp price drop that quickly recovers\u2014a common occurrence under volatile, stressful conditions\u2014will have only a minimal impact on the oracle\u2019s reported price. The system effectively waits for confirmation that a de-peg is sustained over time before it materially adjusts its valuation, thereby distinguishing between transient market noise and a genuine pricing dislocation.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/820079bfe0c4b22cb182d0d599972e836f3aaa8a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/iy35AjzWqmvfhM53DbL7PnFpuga.png?dl=1\" title=\"Raw feed vs. EMA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/820079bfe0c4b22cb182d0d599972e836f3aaa8a.png\" alt=\"Raw feed vs. EMA\" data-base62-sha1=\"iy35AjzWqmvfhM53DbL7PnFpuga\" width=\"1600\" height=\"880\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The practical implication of this EMA mechanism is improving user protection and protocol safety. As our simulations show, collateral positions are not immediately subject to liquidation during temporary de-pegs. This creates a critical buffer period, allowing time for market arbitrage to potentially restore the peg or for users to manage their positions by adding collateral. This design balances the protocol\u2019s need to respond to genuine de-pegs while protecting users from forced liquidations caused by short-term volatility.</p>\n<p>This deliberate stability, however, introduces a tradeoff that must be considered: the system\u2019s response to a slow, protracted de-peg that falls outside the distribution of historical volatility. Feed updates would be infrequent if a de-peg were to develop slowly and remain just within the Chainlink feed\u2019s 0.5% deviation threshold. As the final heatmap illustrates, with a low-alpha EMA, it could take numerous updates (&gt;5) for the oracle price to catch up, creating a window where the spread between EMA and raw price is apparent.</p>\n<p>This risk is substantially mitigated by the oracle\u2019s design; the EMA does not operate in a vacuum. A genuine, prolonged de-peg is highly likely to manifest across metrics the system monitors, such as increased redemption pressure, declining mint/redeem buffer, or even a reported undercollateralization, triggering a protective freeze before significant bad debt can accrue. A second, more benign tradeoff is that the oracle price will also recover back to its peg more slowly after a stress event stabilizes. For Aave, this is an acceptable outcome, as the minimal resulting price spread would not create meaningful arbitrage opportunities or significantly lower the borrowing power of the collateral.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d691890de0a410351a45abf2eca2e82e08d83fe9.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uC9Zb7urQnIhjvq5hpir99VKBPX.png?dl=1\" title=\"EMA Price Evolution\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d691890de0a410351a45abf2eca2e82e08d83fe9.png\" alt=\"EMA Price Evolution\" data-base62-sha1=\"uC9Zb7urQnIhjvq5hpir99VKBPX\" width=\"970\" height=\"699\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59468-conclusion-and-next-steps-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-conclusion-and-next-steps-10\"></a>Conclusion and Next Steps</h2>\n<p>This proposal represents a significant evolution in how Aave manages the risks associated with integrated assets like USDe. By moving from a static peg to a dynamic, risk\u2011managed framework, Aave can better balance user protection with protocol solvency. The system combines a responsive pricing mechanism that adapts to conditions with a proactive circuit breaker that limits exposure when credible stress emerges.</p>\n<p>We are working closely with Chainlink to implement both components\u2014the risk\u2011managed feed and the action\u2011taking mechanism\u2014so they share the same reliability, transparency, and operational discipline as the price oracles already trusted by Aave. The intent is to publish all inputs and state changes on-chain, preserving transparency while ensuring robust automation and liveness through Chainlink\u2019s infrastructure.</p>\n<p>We will also work closely with the Ethena team to identify operational limitations and set reasonable expectations for determining potential stress scenarios. Our highest priority is to advance Aave\u2019s pricing strategies toward improved resilience in all scenarios while maintaining superior user assurances. Ensuring these qualities will require Ethena\u2019s alignment with Aave risk service providers and their support for the final system design.</p>\n<p>The immediate next steps are to finalize the system\u2019s thresholds and integrate guardian\u2011controlled fallbacks. Guardians would retain the ability to override, freeze, or revert configuration in edge cases, keeping operational risk assumptions minimal and aligned with the current Chainlink oracle model on Aave. This approach improves risk management and capital efficiency while maintaining Aave\u2019s open and permissionless nature.

Recent market events have highlighted the importance of having resilient collateral pricing strategies to mitigate the solvency risk Aave takes on. Given these events, it is prudent to upgrade Aave\u2019s USDe pricing mechanism, which currently pegs USDe to the USDT market price.</p>\n<p>The proposed system creates a more resilient and proactive framework that protects Aave from solvency risk while shielding users from premature liquidations caused by transient market dislocations. This improvement is enabled by <a class=\"mention\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com/u/chainlink_labs\">@Chainlink_Labs</a>, whose battle-tested decentralized oracle network (DON) infrastructure already underpins numerous data and interoperability oracle services used by Aave (e.g., Price Feeds, Proof of Reserve, CCIP, LlamaGuard NAV).</p>\n<p>At this time, supply caps are set in Ethena-related assets such that Aave has up to $5.5B additional potential exposure to Ethena. To mitigate risks of this potential additional exposure, this trust-minimized system consists of two parts: 1) the dynamic, risk-managed pricing oracle, using the most representative pricing source in different situations, and 2) the protective action-taking mechanism, performing USDe-related reserve freezes if any of the specified risk signals indicate potential solvency stress. These components shield Aave from further harm while protecting current users, creating a more resilient and secure solution.</p>\n<p>A critical aspect of this architecture is that it introduces no additional trust assumptions. The entire solution will run on-chain with DAO-approved oversight and via the existing Chainlink infrastructure. LlamaRisk will have no privileged access controls and cannot make unilateral changes to the system\u2019s logic or parameters. This design ensures the system is both highly secure and fully auditable. Furthermore, introducing proactiveness into the system will improve Aave\u2019s resiliency and, therefore, can improve the collateral efficiency of Ethena\u2019s assets on Aave.</p>\n<p>This is an early-stage proposal to kick off discussion on fundamental upgrades to Aave\u2019s pricing strategies. We continue to collaborate with Ethena on suitable system stress indicators and parameterization of emergency response. Our highest priority is to ensure the continued stability of Aave markets and support its safe exposure to Ethena assets for the benefit of both protocols and their users.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59468-motivation-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-motivation-2\"></a>Motivation</h2>\n<p>Aave currently prices USDe on par with the USDT price feed. This design was chosen deliberately to safeguard Aave users from the risk of unnecessary liquidations, while tying USDe\u2019s price to its most heavily weighted backing asset for hedging positions (i.e., USDT), and the largest stablecoin backing allocation. Given that USDe can experience temporary de-pegs driven by market sentiment or short-term liquidity constraints on secondary markets, a direct market-priced oracle could trigger liquidations that do not reflect USDe\u2019s actual backing. While this approach effectively protects borrowers, it transfers the solvency risk to the Aave protocol.</p>\n<p>In a fundamental backing-related USDe failure scenario, the on-par pricing would prevent necessary liquidations until the oracle is manually updated, potentially leading to an accumulation of bad debt, as outlined in <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-susde-and-usde-price-feed-update/20495\">extensive discussions</a> earlier this year. Protection from further exposure depends on a manual freeze initiated by the Guardian multisig. This method introduces inherent latency, as the process necessitates a coordinated human response for situational analysis, signature collection, and transaction execution. Nonetheless, this framework was chosen because Aave already bears most of Ethena\u2019s solvency risks.</p>\n<p>During the October 10th aggressive cryptocurrency market volatility events on centralized exchanges, most notably Binance, USDe\u2019s secondary market price experienced a significant, albeit temporary de-peg, moving the price down to $0.65 at the lowest point. However, it is crucial to note that Ethena\u2019s core redemption mechanism proved resilient despite this secondary market dislocation. The protocol handled a significant inflow of redemptions during this event and during the previous stressful event of the Bybit exploit, keeping the redemption flow completely functional and successfully processing more than a billion dollars of USDe redemptions without issue.</p>\n<p>While Aave avoided immediate issues from the de-peg on Binance by pricing USDe on par with USDT, the crypto community again raised concerns that this was not an optimal pricing method. In a real insolvency event, this approach would cause Aave to assume all of Ethena\u2019s solvency risk, as the protocol could be exploited as an exit venue for USDe holders. Such tail risks must be addressed proactively.</p>\n<p>Note: Chainlink USDe/USD price feed, which sources from multiple venues, did not deviate significantly during this localized de-peg, registering a minor 70 basis point deviation, in line with broader market pricing.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59468-why-is-exposure-limiting-important-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-why-is-exposure-limiting-important-3\"></a>Why is Exposure Limiting Important?</h3>\n<p>Aave currently prices USDe collateral using the Chainlink USDT/USD price feed. This pricing mechanism creates a critical dependency: in the event of a fundamental failure of Ethena\u2019s backing, USDe\u2019s market price could collapse, but the USDT/USD oracle used by Aave would remain stable at ~$1.00. This opens a window for exploitation:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Acquire de-pegged USDe at a steep discount on the open market.</li>\n<li>Deposit it into Aave, valued at ~$1.00 via the USDT price feed.</li>\n<li>Borrow fully collateralized assets against it up to the maximum LTV.</li>\n<li>Default on the loan, leaving Aave with overpriced collateral and bad debt.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>To understand the magnitude of the potential bad debt that could be created from this point forward, the table below outlines the maximum new debt that could be created against USDe-related assets. This is calculated using the remaining available supply capacity for each asset. In a de-peg scenario, this entire amount could be rapidly borrowed against newly deposited, devalued collateral, turning into immediate bad debt for the Aave protocol.</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"text-align:left\">Asset Name</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:center\">Max LTV (%)</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Supply Cap ($M)</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Currently Supplied ($M)</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Remaining Capacity ($M)</th>\n<th style=\"text-align:right\">Potential New Debt ($M)</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">USDe</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">94.0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2,700</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">920</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">1,780</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">1,673</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">sUSDe (Staked USDe)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">90.0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2,050</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">1,010</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">1,040</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">936</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">eUSDe (Pre-deposit Vault)</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">94.0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">550</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">64</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">487</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">457</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">PT sUSDe Nov 2025</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">92.0</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">2,380</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">1,540</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">840</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">773</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\">PT USDe Nov 2025</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\">92.6</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">1,990</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">175</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">1,815</td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\">1,681</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"text-align:left\"><strong>Total Immediate Risk Exposure</strong></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:center\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\"></td>\n<td style=\"text-align:right\"><strong>5,521</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><p>In comparison, Ethena\u2019s current stablecoin backing is at $7.35B.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59468-improving-upon-the-system-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-improving-upon-the-system-4\"></a>Improving Upon the System</h2>\n<p>The choice between user protection and protocol solvency is not a binary one. A more advanced system can be implemented to achieve both. We propose a new framework that separates the oracle\u2019s functions into two distinct components: a dynamic pricing system and a proactive action-taking system. The pricing system is designed to switch between different data sources based on real-time indicators of Ethena\u2019s health, ensuring the most appropriate price for USDe is used under various conditions. The action-taking system works in parallel as a circuit breaker, capable of freezing the USDe markets to protect Aave\u2019s solvency if severe stress signals are detected and avoid additional exposure. Together, these components create a comprehensive, responsive, prudent risk management framework.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59468-the-action-taking-system-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-the-action-taking-system-5\"></a>The Action-Taking System</h3>\n<p>The Action-Taking System is a proactive safety mechanism. This system is minimally invasive for existing users and, importantly, is not responsible for determining liquidation prices. It acts as an emergency circuit breaker to protect the protocol, freezing the USDe-priced reserves and implicitly limiting the incremental exposure to USDe\u2019s solvency.</p>\n<p>The circuit breaker is triggered by stress signals from any of the following four distinct categories, providing comprehensive, defense-in-depth monitoring. These categories are subject to change depending on viability:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Market Stress</strong>: Monitors the market prices of USDe and its backing stablecoins (e.g., USDT, USDC) for signs of broad market de-pegging.</li>\n<li><strong>Redemption-System Stress</strong>: Tracks the on-chain health and operational capacity of Ethena\u2019s core mint and redeem functions.</li>\n<li><strong>Proof of Reserve (PoR) Stress</strong>: Verifies official reports on Ethena\u2019s collateralization to confirm that assets fully back the circulating supply.</li>\n</ol>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/561768da235f8533f66881afa4343735edd9312e.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/chBdt6AAwcYVf7qXRwJyNdglKz4.png?dl=1\" title=\"Action Taking Mechanism\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/561768da235f8533f66881afa4343735edd9312e.png\" alt=\"Action Taking Mechanism\" data-base62-sha1=\"chBdt6AAwcYVf7qXRwJyNdglKz4\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The system acts on a single\u2011trigger basis: if one stress category fires, the system freezes all USDe\u2011priced reserves. Unfreezing happens only after signals normalize for a defined cool\u2011off period. The mechanism is automated through the Chainlink platform, inheriting the same trust and liveness properties as existing Chainlink price feeds.</p>\n<p>The first category is market stress, captured from Chainlink price feeds for the USDe backing stablecoins such as USDT, USDC (and PYUSD if the amount held in the backing is significant to exceed the current reserve fund size). Following the same rationale, stETH/ETH internal exchange rate (and other LSTs) should be included in the aggregation, due to Ethena\u2019s exposure to these LSTs as part of its hedging assets portfolio. If these prices trade below $0.99, the system interprets that as a broad, cross\u2011stable dislocation rather than a single\u2011venue artifact. Price weakness in the stablecoin complex tends to precede redemption pressure, so reacting here gives Aave time to contain risk before stress propagates into positions.</p>\n<p>The second category is redemption\u2011system stress, which monitors the health of Ethena\u2019s mint/redeem process directly on-chain. The mechanism monitors whether the redemption buffer is replenished to at least $2M within 50 blocks, and whether the redemption contract is paused. Any of these conditions suggests that operational liquidity is constrained or deliberately throttled. When redemptions cannot be served promptly, the safest course is to ensure Aave cannot be used as exit liquidity while Ethena stabilizes operations.</p>\n<p>The third category is the PoR reported by Ethena and verified by independent third parties, including LlamaRisk, Chaos Labs, and Chainlink. It accepts the PoR report as an authority on Ethena\u2019s solvency and will trigger action if collateralization &lt; 100% is reported. This is most likely a lagging indicator, given the infrequent PoR updates; however, it is the most direct insight available about the state of Ethena\u2019s reserves.</p>\n<p>Future upgrades to the Action Taking Mechanism can include hedging stress indicators that take perp exchange data, such as slippage, spot vs. perp spreads, and funding rates as proactive risk triggers. To minimize false positives, such trigger conditions shall involve extensive analysis and back testing by Aave risk providers working in collaboration with the Ethena team.</p>\n<p>When any category triggers, the system freezes USDe\u2011priced reserves across Aave. A freeze halts new borrows and disables new collateral enables on the affected assets, but existing positions continue to accrue interest and can be repaid or deleveraged normally. Liquidations can also happen during that time, facilitating exposure lowering. This design prevents Aave from becoming an exit venue during stress and caps incremental exposure without forcing liquidations purely due to transient signals.</p>\n<p>The scope of the freeze includes USDe itself and downstream assets priced from it, such as sUSDe and PT\u2011USDe, ensuring consistent behavior. After all triggered indicators clear (metrics back within thresholds), the mechanism waits for a cool\u2011off interval\u2014defined in blocks or minutes\u2014before automatically unfreezing; Guardians and governance retain override capability for exceptional cases.</p>\n<p>Because the circuit breaker only freezes new supply and borrows, and never changes collateral valuations, it does not create bad debt. It simply buys time for pricing to converge and for operations to normalize, allowing natural repayments and deleveraging to proceed. In effect, the mechanism mitigates Aave\u2019s exposure to USDe\u2011related insolvency risk, yet minimizes user disruption and preserves the protocol\u2019s openness once conditions stabilize. Our design, however, prioritizes stable protocol operation; therefore, we implement risk triggers that minimize instances of false positives.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59468-risk-managed-pricing-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-risk-managed-pricing-6\"></a>Risk-managed Pricing</h3>\n<p>The core of the new proposal is a dynamic pricing logic that evaluates a hierarchy of signals to determine the preferred USDe pricing method. The system is designed to be resilient, defaulting to the most reflective pricing sources as risk signals appear. The logic is illustrated in the following flow chart.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/e0078ca7db8ec2f7dc75bacb3af17fa33f94ceb4.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/vXR7VVC5CogiGzvhcP8yxB9ueGg.png?dl=1\" title=\"Risk Managed Feed\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/e0078ca7db8ec2f7dc75bacb3af17fa33f94ceb4.png\" alt=\"Risk Managed Feed\" data-base62-sha1=\"vXR7VVC5CogiGzvhcP8yxB9ueGg\" width=\"1600\" height=\"900\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The system operates as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It first checks Ethena\u2019s core operational health by verifying if redemptions are being processed promptly and the mint/redeem buffer has been replenished to at least $2M over the last 50* blocks (~10 minutes). Suppose the redemption buffer is not being replenished on time. In that case, it indicates a severe operational issue, and the system switches to a market-based pricing source, a time-weighted USDe/USD market price oracle.</li>\n<li>If redemptions are operational, the system verifies Ethena\u2019s Proof of Reserves (PoR) from the attestors - LlamaRisk, Chainlink, Chaos Labs &amp; HT Digital - to check if the system is fully collateralized. If collateralization is below 1, it signifies a direct risk to USDe\u2019s backing, and the system then defaults to a mechanism that defines USDe price as the latest USDe redemption rate returned in the Mint/Redeem contract. It is notable that due to the assumed staleness of Ethena\u2019s PoR (currently reported at a 7-day frequency), the indicated collateralization cannot be taken as an accurate measure of the exact USDe backing level, needing to source the USDe backing rate from the Mint/Redeem contract.</li>\n<li>If redemptions and collateralization are healthy, it performs a final check on the live redemption rate from Ethena\u2019s Mint/Redeem contract. If the rate is at or very near par, excluding the usual 10 bps redemption fee (&gt;= 0.999) and gas costs (which are included in the exchange rate calculation), the system is considered fully healthy. Due to the gas cost impact on the exchange rate, a redemption size threshold would be applied. In this state, the oracle can use the most accurate of several price sources, either the currently used Chainlink USDT/USD price or an aggregate market price measure of the stable assets backing USDe and denominating the perpetual hedging pairs.</li>\n<li>If the redemption rate is below this threshold, the oracle will use it as the price source, again applying a redemption size threshold. In cases where the initial checks on redemptions or PoR reported collateralization fail, the system switches to a time-weighted USDe/USD oracle price, which is designed to handle market stress gracefully, not switching to a potentially more aggressive market price of USDe at an instant, but doing it gradually.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: Ethena has been briefed on the overall operational flow, and we are actively working with their team to align on all trigger conditions and parameterization to ensure high reliability of the dual price feed and the incorporated risk indicators.</em></p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59468-time-based-usde-oracle-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-time-based-usde-oracle-7\"></a>Time-Based USDe Oracle</h3>\n<p>A key component of the stressed-condition response is the time-weighted oracle. This mechanism is designed to smooth out sudden, volatile price dislocations and protect the Aave protocol from the short-lived de-pegs observed historically. This is achieved using a specifically tuned exponential moving average (EMA) of the USDe/USD market price.</p>\n<p>Instead of instantly adopting the new, lower market price during a de-peg, this oracle gradually moves the price from 1 USD toward the Chainlink USDe/USD market price. The adjustment is based on a simple formula where the new price is a weighted average of the current oracle and live market prices. This creates an exponential slope that allows the oracle to catch up to a sustained de-peg quickly but dampens the immediate impact of flash crashes, giving the market time to stabilize and preventing unwarranted liquidations.</p>\n<p>Another effect of the gradual price move is making the positions liquidatable in increments, not aggressively at once. Based on our <a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/arfc-susde-and-usde-price-feed-update/20495/7\">previous analysis</a>, sharp depegs were observed not to have the immediate DEX liquidity depth required to support successful liquidations.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59468-aggregate-market-price-based-on-backing-composition-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-aggregate-market-price-based-on-backing-composition-8\"></a>Aggregate Market Price Based on Backing Composition</h3>\n<p>Instead of relying on a single stablecoin (e.g., USDT) as a fallback reference, we propose an aggregate market\u2011price oracle constructed from the stable assets that back USDe or denominate the perpetual hedging pairs. The idea is straightforward: each constituent stablecoin or asset contributes to the reference price in proportion to its share of Ethena\u2019s effective exposure. If USDT accounts for 50% of the combined backing and hedge\u2011denomination footprint, it receives a 50% weight; if USDC accounts for 20%, it receives a 20% weight; and so on for PYUSD, DAI, or other constituents. If significant, stETH/ETH internal exchange rate (and other LSTs) should be included in the aggregation, due to Ethena\u2019s exposure to these LSTs as part of its hedging assets portfolio. The resulting index reflects the value of the collateral basket and the currency units in which hedge PnL accrues, producing a more accurate proxy for USDe\u2019s underlying economics than any stable.</p>\n<p>Weights would be sourced from Ethena\u2019s reported backing composition, which is already published and can be consumed programmatically. The oracle ingests this composition on a regular cadence (daily by default) and can refresh more frequently if Ethena provides interim updates during periods of rapid rebalancing. For operational reasons, however, frequent updates to the rebalancing may not be possible. Between updates, the index prices each constituent using its respective Chainlink USD feed, applying the most recent weight vector. This approach keeps the price reference aligned with the real-time backing and hedge denomination mix without introducing undue operational churn.</p>\n<p>Operationally, the aggregate index maintains the same trust assumptions as existing Chainlink feeds: constituent prices are read from Chainlink oracles, the weighting and aggregation are executed on a transparent contract, and all parameters and updates are emitted as on\u2011chain events. Governance and Guardians can set guardrails such as maximum per\u2011asset weights, minimum asset quality criteria, and failover behavior if a constituent feed is stale. This produces a robust, auditable fallback that tracks USDe\u2019s effective exposure across the stablecoin complex rather than relying on any single asset.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59468-analysis-takeaways-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-analysis-takeaways-9\"></a>Analysis &amp; Takeaways</h2>\n<p>Our analysis of the proposed USDe Risk Managed Oracle validates the design via historical data and simulations. The system\u2019s effectiveness is rooted in its use of verifiable, on-chain signals to inform its pricing and safety mechanisms.</p>\n<p>A primary signal for the action-taking and pricing modules is the status of Ethena\u2019s mint/redeem buffer. From a historical perspective, the contract shows a sole instance where the buffer was depleted, after which it was replenished within 98 blocks. Since that event, Ethena has adopted a more conservative management strategy, consistently maintaining a healthy buffer and even increasing its capitalization during periods of high redemption demand. This consistent operational performance is significant because a well-capitalized buffer ensures redemptions can be processed reliably and the value of USDe remains stable. This track record of stability validates using the buffer\u2019s replenishment status as a dependable input for our proposed system. A failure to meet the replenishment threshold, as defined in the proposal, would serve as a clear, data-driven indicator of potential stress, allowing the system to take pre-emptive protective measures.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b0cceb6b37d421cc82badb0f8ced8d7f960ec718.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/pe34wItMTs73DuP7BjnjPqquOzC.png?dl=1\" title=\"Replenishment Periods\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b0cceb6b37d421cc82badb0f8ced8d7f960ec718.png\" alt=\"Replenishment Periods\" data-base62-sha1=\"pe34wItMTs73DuP7BjnjPqquOzC\" width=\"1600\" height=\"1114\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>This operational integrity is also reflected in the on-chain redemption rates. The redemptions are serviced at a constant 1:1 rate, deducting a 10 basis point fee and gas costs, leading to consistent values around the $0.9990 level. The stability of this rate provides a reliable proxy for USDe\u2019s fundamental value, anchored directly to its backing assets rather than fluctuating secondary market sentiment. In scenarios where market prices become dislocated, this on-chain rate offers a stable valuation anchor in scenarios where market prices become dislocated, especially as the mint/redeem contract remains functional. The proposed oracle is designed to leverage this, incorporating an adjusted redemption rate as a pricing source under specific stress conditions. This ensures the system has a logical, economically grounded value to fall back on, preventing it from being immediately influenced by temporary market panic or pricing anomalies.</p>\n<p>Backtesting the proposed pricing feeds reveals further insights into its expected functioning. During a recent de-peg event, the observed spread between USDe and USDT widened notably. This was caused by a decrease in USDe\u2019s price and a simultaneous increase in USDT\u2019s price, driven by high demand for stablecoins during market-wide liquidations. This event illustrates the limitations of a single-asset peg for an asset like USDe, whose backing is composed of multiple stablecoins. The proposed system addresses this by incorporating an aggregate stablecoin feed designed to reflect the composition of USDe\u2019s backing more closely. By sourcing prices from a basket of assets (USDT, USDC, PYUSD) and LSTs\u2019 internal exchange rates, the feed\u2019s construction goes a step further: the weights of these assets would be dynamically adjusted based on Ethena\u2019s reported backing data. This approach creates a price benchmark representing USDe\u2019s actual collateral dependencies. Instead of enforcing a full correlation with a single asset like USDT, the oracle\u2019s price would inherently reflect the weighted value of its true backing. Consequently, should an issue arise with a single constituent stablecoin, its impact on USDe\u2019s valuation would be adequately weighted according to its share of the collateral, providing a more accurate risk assessment and a more resilient price feed than a simple peg to USDT.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9acfbd35eda33599efa073e9900f3865f50adc41.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/m5wBMDxabtZSoKYGt489vwkXANH.png?dl=1\" title=\"Prices &amp; Spread\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9acfbd35eda33599efa073e9900f3865f50adc41.png\" alt=\"Prices &amp; Spread\" data-base62-sha1=\"m5wBMDxabtZSoKYGt489vwkXANH\" width=\"1600\" height=\"768\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>A central element for managing market stress within the proposal is the mechanism for transitioning the oracle\u2019s price. A direct switch to a raw market price feed during volatility is suboptimal, as immediate price shocks on secondary markets are often more aggressive and rapid than any potential impairment to the underlying backing. To address this, the proposal utilizes a time-weighted price based on an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) to serve as a controlled, gradual smoothing mechanism. Our backtesting confirms that an EMA with a low alpha parameter (in the 0.05 to 0.1 range) is most effective. By design, a low-alpha EMA gives more weight to its stable historical price than to the most recent, and potentially volatile, market update. This means that a sudden, sharp price drop that quickly recovers\u2014a common occurrence under volatile, stressful conditions\u2014will have only a minimal impact on the oracle\u2019s reported price. The system effectively waits for confirmation that a de-peg is sustained over time before it materially adjusts its valuation, thereby distinguishing between transient market noise and a genuine pricing dislocation.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/820079bfe0c4b22cb182d0d599972e836f3aaa8a.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/iy35AjzWqmvfhM53DbL7PnFpuga.png?dl=1\" title=\"Raw feed vs. EMA\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/8/820079bfe0c4b22cb182d0d599972e836f3aaa8a.png\" alt=\"Raw feed vs. EMA\" data-base62-sha1=\"iy35AjzWqmvfhM53DbL7PnFpuga\" width=\"1600\" height=\"880\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>The practical implication of this EMA mechanism is improving user protection and protocol safety. As our simulations show, collateral positions are not immediately subject to liquidation during temporary de-pegs. This creates a critical buffer period, allowing time for market arbitrage to potentially restore the peg or for users to manage their positions by adding collateral. This design balances the protocol\u2019s need to respond to genuine de-pegs while protecting users from forced liquidations caused by short-term volatility.</p>\n<p>This deliberate stability, however, introduces a tradeoff that must be considered: the system\u2019s response to a slow, protracted de-peg that falls outside the distribution of historical volatility. Feed updates would be infrequent if a de-peg were to develop slowly and remain just within the Chainlink feed\u2019s 0.5% deviation threshold. As the final heatmap illustrates, with a low-alpha EMA, it could take numerous updates (&gt;5) for the oracle price to catch up, creating a window where the spread between EMA and raw price is apparent.</p>\n<p>This risk is substantially mitigated by the oracle\u2019s design; the EMA does not operate in a vacuum. A genuine, prolonged de-peg is highly likely to manifest across metrics the system monitors, such as increased redemption pressure, declining mint/redeem buffer, or even a reported undercollateralization, triggering a protective freeze before significant bad debt can accrue. A second, more benign tradeoff is that the oracle price will also recover back to its peg more slowly after a stress event stabilizes. For Aave, this is an acceptable outcome, as the minimal resulting price spread would not create meaningful arbitrage opportunities or significantly lower the borrowing power of the collateral.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d691890de0a410351a45abf2eca2e82e08d83fe9.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/uC9Zb7urQnIhjvq5hpir99VKBPX.png?dl=1\" title=\"EMA Price Evolution\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/d/d691890de0a410351a45abf2eca2e82e08d83fe9.png\" alt=\"EMA Price Evolution\" data-base62-sha1=\"uC9Zb7urQnIhjvq5hpir99VKBPX\" width=\"970\" height=\"699\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-59468-conclusion-and-next-steps-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-conclusion-and-next-steps-10\"></a>Conclusion and Next Steps</h2>\n<p>This proposal represents a significant evolution in how Aave manages the risks associated with integrated assets like USDe. By moving from a static peg to a dynamic, risk\u2011managed framework, Aave can better balance user protection with protocol solvency. The system combines a responsive pricing mechanism that adapts to conditions with a proactive circuit breaker that limits exposure when credible stress emerges.</p>\n<p>We are working closely with Chainlink to implement both components\u2014the risk\u2011managed feed and the action\u2011taking mechanism\u2014so they share the same reliability, transparency, and operational discipline as the price oracles already trusted by Aave. The intent is to publish all inputs and state changes on-chain, preserving transparency while ensuring robust automation and liveness through Chainlink\u2019s infrastructure.</p>\n<p>We will also work closely with the Ethena team to identify operational limitations and set reasonable expectations for determining potential stress scenarios. Our highest priority is to advance Aave\u2019s pricing strategies toward improved resilience in all scenarios while maintaining superior user assurances. Ensuring these qualities will require Ethena\u2019s alignment with Aave risk service providers and their support for the final system design.</p>\n<p>The immediate next steps are to finalize the system\u2019s thresholds and integrate guardian\u2011controlled fallbacks. Guardians would retain the ability to override, freeze, or revert configuration in edge cases, keeping operational risk assumptions minimal and aligned with the current Chainlink oracle model on Aave. This approach improves risk management and capital efficiency while maintaining Aave\u2019s open and permissionless nature. We welcome comments and discussion from the community and Aave\u2019s service providers to refine the design and help the DAO make a measured, well\u2011informed decision.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-59468-disclaimer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-59468-disclaimer-11\"></a>Disclaimer</h3>\n<p>LlamaRisk has not been compensated by any third party for publishing this proposal.
