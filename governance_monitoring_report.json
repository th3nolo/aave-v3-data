      "description": "\n            <h1><a name=\"p-61208-overview-1\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-overview-1\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Overview</h1>\n<p>The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate and propose the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes for WETH, cbBTC, and WBTC on Aave v3. These configurations are designed to allow users to opt into a borrowing environment where supplied collateral is not rehypothecated, thereby eliminating liquidity and liquidation execution risk arising from rehypothecation, removing borrower exposure to counterparty default risk, and enabling more competitive risk parameterization.</p>\n<p>Historically, Aave has mostly relied on a pooled collateral model in which supplied assets are rehypothecated to support capital efficient lending markets. This design has formed the foundation of Aave\u2019s growth and remains the dominant structure across onchain lending today. In parallel, relatively small but steadily growing segment of onchain lending has emerged around segregated collateral models, where supplied assets are escrowed and never lent out to other borrowers. This approach has been particularly favored for bluechip collateral assets, such as BTC wrappers, where borrowers tend to prioritize risk isolation, predictable liquidity, and the elimination of counterparty exposure over maximizing supply yield.</p>\n<p>As onchain lending matures and borrower preferences diversify, supporting both pooled and segregated collateral experiences becomes increasingly important. Introducing segregated bluechip E-Modes allows Aave to participate in this growing segment, expand its addressable borrower base, and capture demand from users who prefer an escrowed collateral model, while preserving the existing pooled markets for users who continue to value capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>Our recommendation is to support the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes for WETH, cbBTC, and WBTC on Core, Arbitrum and Base instances as a complementary option to existing pooled markets. This approach expands the protocol design space without disrupting current users, improves risk segmentation, and allows Aave to better serve heterogeneous borrower preferences.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-terminology-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-terminology-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Terminology</strong></h1>\n<p>This section defines the core terminology used throughout the analysis to ensure a shared and consistent understanding of the concepts discussed. The distinction between segregated and pooled collateral models is central to this proposal, and clarifying these terms upfront is intended to avoid ambiguity and ensure that subsequent discussion, evaluation, and governance deliberation are grounded in a common conceptual framework.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-non-rehypothecated-collateral-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-non-rehypothecated-collateral-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Segregated (Non Rehypothecated) Collateral</h2>\n<p>Segregated collateral refers to a lending design in which supplied assets are escrowed and not lent out to other borrowers under any circumstances. Collateral supplied under this model remains fully segregated and continuously available, regardless of market utilization or borrowing activity elsewhere in the protocol.</p>\n<p>From the borrower perspective, this structure ensures that collateral can always be withdrawn immediately upon loan repayment, without dependency on external liquidity conditions. From the protocol and liquidator perspective, escrowed collateral is always available to facilitate timely liquidations when positions approach or breach required collateralization thresholds. As a result, liquidity availability for withdrawals and liquidation execution is guaranteed by design.</p>\n<p>The primary tradeoff of this model is reduced capital efficiency. Because escrowed collateral is not deployed elsewhere in the system, it does not generate yield for the supplier, and borrowing costs are not offset by supply side interest.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-pooled-rehypothecated-collateral-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-pooled-rehypothecated-collateral-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Pooled (Rehypothecated) Collateral</h2>\n<p>Pooled collateral refers to the traditional lending model used by Aave and most onchain money markets, where supplied assets are pooled and made available for borrowing by other users. In this structure, collateral backing a loan is not held idle but is instead lent out within the protocol to support additional borrowing activity.</p>\n<p>This design enables higher capital efficiency by allowing supplied assets to generate yield, which in turn lowers net borrowing costs for users and supports deeper, more liquid markets across multiple asset pairs. Pooled collateral models are therefore well suited for users who value yield generation and capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>However, because collateral is actively deployed, its availability is subject to overall market utilization. In periods of high utilization, collateral may not be immediately withdrawable, and liquidation execution relies on sufficient available liquidity within the pool. As a result, lenders and the protocol implicitly take on additional liquidity and counterparty exposure relative to segregated collateral models, all else being equal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-motivation-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The onchain lending market has reached a meaningful scale, with total active loans across chains and lending protocols amounting to approximately $36.7 billion. The majority of this activity continues to be concentrated in pooled lending markets. Approximately 81% of total active loans, or roughly $30 billion, are issued against rehypothecated collateral structures.</p>\n<p>Within this segment, Aave represents the dominant share. Aave accounts for approximately 62% of total active onchain loans and roughly 76% of all loans issued against rehypothecated collateral. This highlights both Aave\u2019s central role in the pooled lending ecosystem and its strong product market fit for capital efficient, rehypothecated lending models.</p>\n<p>In contrast, lending activity backed by segregated, escrowed collateral remains smaller in absolute terms but is far from negligible. Active loans issued against segregated collateral currently total approximately $6.8 billion. While this represents a minority share of the overall lending market, it reflects a distinct and growing user preference for non rehypothecated collateral designs.</p>\n<p>Growth trends over the past year further reinforce this observation. Active loans issued through pooled lending protocols increased by approximately 56%, while active loans issued through segregated lending protocols increased by approximately 90% over the same period. The higher percentage growth observed in segregated lending is partly attributable to its smaller starting base. In absolute terms, however, pooled lending protocols, driven primarily by Aave, accounted for the larger share of net growth in active loans.</p>\n<p>Recent upgrades in Aave v3.6 introduce additional flexibility that enables clearer separation of collateral behaviors and more granular market configurations, making factual collateral segregation feasible where it was previously constrained. This expanded design space allows Aave to serve a broader range of borrower preferences without disrupting existing pooled markets.</p>\n<p>Taken together, these trends indicate that segregated collateral lending is evolving from a niche design into a meaningful and expanding segment of onchain credit markets. While pooled rehypothecated lending remains dominant, demand for escrowed collateral structures is growing steadily. The primary motivation for this proposal is therefore to enable Aave to participate in this segment, capture emerging demand, and extend its market leadership to users who prefer segregated collateral experiences, while continuing to support and preserve its core pooled lending markets.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b762a2adbc56cea92e84a543b8d06c4a6d4bd165.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qaiHyMNwsle7oXjWsVr7ME5p8Gh.png?dl=1\" title=\"image (3)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b762a2adbc56cea92e84a543b8d06c4a6d4bd165.png\" alt=\"image (3)\" data-base62-sha1=\"qaiHyMNwsle7oXjWsVr7ME5p8Gh\" width=\"1010\" height=\"725\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-high-level-design-and-implementation-approach-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-high-level-design-and-implementation-approach-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>High Level Design and Implementation Approach</h1>\n<p>This section outlines a high level design for enabling segregated bluechip collateral borrowing on Aave v3 without modifying the core pooled markets. The intent is to describe the conceptual mechanism from a risk management perspective, while leaving smart contract implementation details, security considerations, and final architectural decisions to relevant contributors.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-conceptual-architecture-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-conceptual-architecture-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conceptual Architecture</h2>\n<p>At a high level, the segregated collateral experience can be implemented by introducing wrapper assets for each targeted bluechip collateral. These wrapper assets are designed solely to represent escrowed collateral positions and to ensure that the underlying asset is not made available for borrowing.</p>\n<p><strong>Wrapper Contracts and Segregated Wrapper Assets</strong></p>\n<p>For each asset covered in this proposal, a dedicated wrapper contract would accept deposits of the underlying token and mint a corresponding segregated wrapper token (sToken) on a 1:1 basis.</p>\n<p>Examples include the following mappings.</p>\n<p>WETH to sWETH<br>\ncbBTC to scbBTC<br>\nWBTC to sWBTC</p>\n<p>The wrapper naming and symbols are illustrative and can be finalized during implementation. The core requirement is that each wrapper token is always and immediately redeemable for its underlying at a 1:1 rate, similar to the WETH9 implementation and with minimal functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>Aave v3 Listings and Collateral Configuration</strong></p>\n<p>The segregated wrapper assets would then be listed on Aave v3 as collateral and configured as non-borrowable. This configuration ensures that the supplied collateral cannot be borrowed by other users, which is the central property required to prevent rehypothecation.</p>\n<p>From the user perspective, supplying the segregated wrapper asset should function similarly to supplying any other collateral, with the distinction that the supplied balance is not part of the borrowable liquidity pool and is only usable as collateral within its designated E-Mode category.</p>\n<p><strong>E-Mode Configuration and Stablecoin Access</strong></p>\n<p>To preserve existing liquidity and user experience for stablecoin borrowing, the proposal relies on E-Mode categories that allow segregated wrapper collateral to access the existing core stablecoin markets.</p>\n<p>Concretely, the design would introduce dedicated E-Mode categories that include the segregated wrapper collateral assets and the relevant stablecoin borrow assets already listed on the instance.</p>\n<p>This approach allows segregated collateral users to borrow from the existing deep stablecoin reserves.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-user-flow-and-integration-at-a-high-level-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-user-flow-and-integration-at-a-high-level-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>User Flow and Integration at a High Level</h2>\n<p>From a user flow perspective, the mechanism can be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p>A user who opts into the segregated pathway deposits WETH, cbBTC, or WBTC. The corresponding wrapper contract receives the deposited asset and mints a segregated wrapper token (sToken) on a 1:1 basis. The minted sToken is then supplied to Aave on behalf of the user, where it functions exclusively as collateral in E-mode and cannot be borrowed by other participants.</p>\n<p>When the user repays their debt and withdraws collateral, the flow reverses. The wrapper token is withdrawn from Aave, burned in exchange for the underlying, and the underlying token is returned to the user.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-pricing-and-oracle-considerations-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-pricing-and-oracle-considerations-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Pricing and Oracle Considerations</h2>\n<p>The segregated wrapper assets are intended to maintain strict 1:1 parity with their underlying tokens, as they are simple proxy contracts. As a result, the wrapper assets should be priced identically to their underlying assets. This can be achieved by reusing the existing oracle configuration for the underlying assets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-user-experience-and-interface-considerations-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-user-experience-and-interface-considerations-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>User Experience and Interface Considerations</h1>\n<p>The introduction of segregated bluechip collaterals is intended to have minimal impact on the existing Aave user experience and interface. The proposal is designed to extend current functionality rather than alter existing workflows, ensuring that users who prefer pooled markets can continue interacting with the protocol without disruption.</p>\n<p>From a frontend perspective, the segregated wrapper assets (sTokens) would be listed alongside existing assets in the Aave interface, following the same conventions used for other listed tokens. Each wrapper asset would be clearly labeled to reflect its segregated nature, for example sWETH \u2013 Segregated Wrapped Ether, scbBTC \u2013 Segregated Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin, and sWBTC \u2013 Segregated Wrapped Bitcoin. This naming convention is intended to provide immediate clarity to users regarding the collateral treatment of these assets.</p>\n<p>User interaction flows would remain consistent with current behavior. Supplying segregated collateral, entering the relevant E-Mode, borrowing stablecoins, and managing positions would follow the same steps and interface patterns already familiar to Aave users. The primary difference is the explicit choice at deposit time between supplying the underlying asset into the pooled market or into its segregated counterpart.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-risk-and-benefit-assessment-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-risk-and-benefit-assessment-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk and Benefit Assessment</strong></h1>\n<p>This section outlines the primary benefits and risks associated with the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes, with a focus on protocol level considerations, borrower outcomes, and potential second order effects.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-benefits-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-benefits-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Benefits</h3>\n<p>The proposal enables Aave v3 to directly participate in the growing segment of segregated collateral lending within the broader borrow lend ecosystem. While pooled lending remains dominant, segregated collateral borrowing is exhibiting sustained growth, and supporting this design allows Aave to capture incremental demand rather than ceding this segment to alternative protocols.</p>\n<p>Certainty around liquidity availability materially improves the risk profile of segregated collateral positions. Because collateral is escrowed and never rehypothecated, the protocol can safely support higher borrowing power through better LTV and LT configurations, improving competitiveness for borrowers.</p>\n<p>Guaranteed liquidity availability also ensures that liquidations are not halted or delayed during periods of market volatility due to elevated utilization. This removes a key execution risk present in pooled markets when market approaches full utilization levels and supports more predictable system behavior under stress.</p>\n<p>Lastly, borrowers using segregated collateral also avoid counterparty exposure to other borrowers. Since collateral is not lent out, borrowers are insulated from risks associated with third party defaults or liquidity shortfalls elsewhere in the protocol, resulting in a clearer and more contained risk profile.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-risks-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-risks-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risks</strong></h3>\n<p>The primary risk associated with this proposal relates to potential liquidity migration from pooled markets to segregated markets, particularly for ETH collateral. ETH is a highly utilized market and serves as foundational liquidity supporting large LST and LRT borrowing activity. A meaningful migration of existing ETH supply from pooled markets into segregated configurations could reduce available liquidity for LST and LRT markets and negatively impact overall protocol revenue.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this risk, segregated ETH E-Modes should be introduced with tighter initial supply caps relative to BTC based segregated configurations and monitored closely following deployment. This approach allows governance to observe whether segregated E-Modes are primarily attracting new borrowing demand or instead incentivizing migration of existing positions from pooled markets. Parameter adjustments and caps can then be iteratively refined based on observed usage patterns and their impact on broader market health.</p>\n<p>Overall, while the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes introduces a tradeoff between borrowing power, capital efficiency and risk isolation, the proposed design, combined with conservative rollout parameters and active monitoring, allows Aave to explore this design space without materially compromising the stability or profitability of existing pooled markets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-lt-configuration-considerations-for-segregated-markets-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-lt-configuration-considerations-for-segregated-markets-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>LT Configuration Considerations for Segregated Markets</strong></h1>\n<p>The recommended thresholds are outputs of Chaos Labs VaR-based simulation frameworks that evaluate downside price moves and liquidation feasibility under a range of market conditions, including stressed environments.</p>\n<p>While the specific modeling assumptions and parameterization are subject to refinement and implementation level review, the key calibration intuition is straightforward. In segregated configurations, collateral is escrowed and not rehypothecated, which improves certainty around collateral availability during liquidation events. In addition, collateral is segregated from pooled liquidity dynamics and is not cross margined with broader pool utilization, reducing reliance on external liquidity conditions for liquidation execution. Together, these factors meaningfully reduce liquidation execution risk and limit second-order effects that can arise when collateral is deployed elsewhere in the system.</p>\n<p>As a result, the protocol can support higher borrowing power for these assets relative to pooled configurations while maintaining conservative liquidation safety margins. The proposed LT values are therefore designed to reflect the improved predictability of liquidation execution and collateral accessibility in segregated markets, while still accounting for underlying price volatility, liquidity conditions of borrow assets, and the operational realities of liquidation execution.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-cross-margin-restrictions-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-cross-margin-restrictions-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Cross Margin Restrictions</strong></h1>\n<p>In historical implementations of E-Modes, the protocol fully isolated parameterized debt assets via the E-Mode mask; however, users could hypothetically add non-whitelisted collateral assets to the aggregate position and borrow E-Mode-whitelisted borrowable assets. This led to aggregated position health being dictated by an effectively cross-margined collateral position, complicating the dynamics surrounding factual isolation.</p>\n<p>With the launch of v3.6, there is now a practical path to pure isolation and to strictly preventing cross-margin within the proposed Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes. Specifically, any collateral asset that is not part of a given E-Mode is configured with a maximum LTV of 0 when that E-Mode is active. This ensures that users who already maintain cross-margin positions, where stablecoins are borrowed against a combination of wrapped bluechip and non bluechip collateral, cannot activate the Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode to improve their health factor, which is explicitly designed to operate without cross-margin exposure.</p>\n<p>Operationally, this requires enumerating all collateral assets that are outside the scope of each Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode and assigning them an LTV of 0 within that E-Mode. To avoid excessive table expansion and to maintain readability, these assets are grouped under an \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d category in the specification tables, with the full list disclosed in the section below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-16\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assets Configured as \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d</strong></h2>\n<p>The following lists of collateral assets that are configured with LTV0 within each Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-17\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Segregated ETH Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-18\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Segregated BTC Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WBTC, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, CBETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-recommendation-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-recommendation-19\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Recommendation</h1>\n<p>We recommend the introduction of segregated bluechip stablecoin E-Modes on Aave v3, supported by the listing of dedicated segregated wrapper assets and conservative initial configuration parameters.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we recommend listing segregated wrapper assets (sTokens) for bluechip collateral and enabling their use exclusively within dedicated segregated stablecoin E-Modes. This includes the listing of sWETH, scbBTC, and sWBTC, with each asset configured as non borrowable and usable as collateral only within its designated E-Mode.

These configurations are designed to allow users to opt into a borrowing environment where supplied collateral is not rehypothecated, thereby eliminating liquidity and liquidation execution risk arising from rehypothecation, removing borrower exposure to counterparty default risk, and enabling more competitive risk parameterization.</p>\n<p>Historically, Aave has mostly relied on a pooled collateral model in which supplied assets are rehypothecated to support capital efficient lending markets. This design has formed the foundation of Aave\u2019s growth and remains the dominant structure across onchain lending today. In parallel, relatively small but steadily growing segment of onchain lending has emerged around segregated collateral models, where supplied assets are escrowed and never lent out to other borrowers. This approach has been particularly favored for bluechip collateral assets, such as BTC wrappers, where borrowers tend to prioritize risk isolation, predictable liquidity, and the elimination of counterparty exposure over maximizing supply yield.</p>\n<p>As onchain lending matures and borrower preferences diversify, supporting both pooled and segregated collateral experiences becomes increasingly important. Introducing segregated bluechip E-Modes allows Aave to participate in this growing segment, expand its addressable borrower base, and capture demand from users who prefer an escrowed collateral model, while preserving the existing pooled markets for users who continue to value capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>Our recommendation is to support the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes for WETH, cbBTC, and WBTC on Core, Arbitrum and Base instances as a complementary option to existing pooled markets. This approach expands the protocol design space without disrupting current users, improves risk segmentation, and allows Aave to better serve heterogeneous borrower preferences.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-terminology-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-terminology-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Terminology</strong></h1>\n<p>This section defines the core terminology used throughout the analysis to ensure a shared and consistent understanding of the concepts discussed. The distinction between segregated and pooled collateral models is central to this proposal, and clarifying these terms upfront is intended to avoid ambiguity and ensure that subsequent discussion, evaluation, and governance deliberation are grounded in a common conceptual framework.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-non-rehypothecated-collateral-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-non-rehypothecated-collateral-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Segregated (Non Rehypothecated) Collateral</h2>\n<p>Segregated collateral refers to a lending design in which supplied assets are escrowed and not lent out to other borrowers under any circumstances. Collateral supplied under this model remains fully segregated and continuously available, regardless of market utilization or borrowing activity elsewhere in the protocol.</p>\n<p>From the borrower perspective, this structure ensures that collateral can always be withdrawn immediately upon loan repayment, without dependency on external liquidity conditions. From the protocol and liquidator perspective, escrowed collateral is always available to facilitate timely liquidations when positions approach or breach required collateralization thresholds. As a result, liquidity availability for withdrawals and liquidation execution is guaranteed by design.</p>\n<p>The primary tradeoff of this model is reduced capital efficiency. Because escrowed collateral is not deployed elsewhere in the system, it does not generate yield for the supplier, and borrowing costs are not offset by supply side interest.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-pooled-rehypothecated-collateral-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-pooled-rehypothecated-collateral-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Pooled (Rehypothecated) Collateral</h2>\n<p>Pooled collateral refers to the traditional lending model used by Aave and most onchain money markets, where supplied assets are pooled and made available for borrowing by other users. In this structure, collateral backing a loan is not held idle but is instead lent out within the protocol to support additional borrowing activity.</p>\n<p>This design enables higher capital efficiency by allowing supplied assets to generate yield, which in turn lowers net borrowing costs for users and supports deeper, more liquid markets across multiple asset pairs. Pooled collateral models are therefore well suited for users who value yield generation and capital efficiency.</p>\n<p>However, because collateral is actively deployed, its availability is subject to overall market utilization. In periods of high utilization, collateral may not be immediately withdrawable, and liquidation execution relies on sufficient available liquidity within the pool. As a result, lenders and the protocol implicitly take on additional liquidity and counterparty exposure relative to segregated collateral models, all else being equal.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-motivation-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-motivation-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Motivation</h1>\n<p>The onchain lending market has reached a meaningful scale, with total active loans across chains and lending protocols amounting to approximately $36.7 billion. The majority of this activity continues to be concentrated in pooled lending markets. Approximately 81% of total active loans, or roughly $30 billion, are issued against rehypothecated collateral structures.</p>\n<p>Within this segment, Aave represents the dominant share. Aave accounts for approximately 62% of total active onchain loans and roughly 76% of all loans issued against rehypothecated collateral. This highlights both Aave\u2019s central role in the pooled lending ecosystem and its strong product market fit for capital efficient, rehypothecated lending models.</p>\n<p>In contrast, lending activity backed by segregated, escrowed collateral remains smaller in absolute terms but is far from negligible. Active loans issued against segregated collateral currently total approximately $6.8 billion. While this represents a minority share of the overall lending market, it reflects a distinct and growing user preference for non rehypothecated collateral designs.</p>\n<p>Growth trends over the past year further reinforce this observation. Active loans issued through pooled lending protocols increased by approximately 56%, while active loans issued through segregated lending protocols increased by approximately 90% over the same period. The higher percentage growth observed in segregated lending is partly attributable to its smaller starting base. In absolute terms, however, pooled lending protocols, driven primarily by Aave, accounted for the larger share of net growth in active loans.</p>\n<p>Recent upgrades in Aave v3.6 introduce additional flexibility that enables clearer separation of collateral behaviors and more granular market configurations, making factual collateral segregation feasible where it was previously constrained. This expanded design space allows Aave to serve a broader range of borrower preferences without disrupting existing pooled markets.</p>\n<p>Taken together, these trends indicate that segregated collateral lending is evolving from a niche design into a meaningful and expanding segment of onchain credit markets. While pooled rehypothecated lending remains dominant, demand for escrowed collateral structures is growing steadily. The primary motivation for this proposal is therefore to enable Aave to participate in this segment, capture emerging demand, and extend its market leadership to users who prefer segregated collateral experiences, while continuing to support and preserve its core pooled lending markets.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b762a2adbc56cea92e84a543b8d06c4a6d4bd165.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/qaiHyMNwsle7oXjWsVr7ME5p8Gh.png?dl=1\" title=\"image (3)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/b762a2adbc56cea92e84a543b8d06c4a6d4bd165.png\" alt=\"image (3)\" data-base62-sha1=\"qaiHyMNwsle7oXjWsVr7ME5p8Gh\" width=\"1010\" height=\"725\"></a></div><p></p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-high-level-design-and-implementation-approach-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-high-level-design-and-implementation-approach-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>High Level Design and Implementation Approach</h1>\n<p>This section outlines a high level design for enabling segregated bluechip collateral borrowing on Aave v3 without modifying the core pooled markets. The intent is to describe the conceptual mechanism from a risk management perspective, while leaving smart contract implementation details, security considerations, and final architectural decisions to relevant contributors.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-conceptual-architecture-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-conceptual-architecture-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Conceptual Architecture</h2>\n<p>At a high level, the segregated collateral experience can be implemented by introducing wrapper assets for each targeted bluechip collateral. These wrapper assets are designed solely to represent escrowed collateral positions and to ensure that the underlying asset is not made available for borrowing.</p>\n<p><strong>Wrapper Contracts and Segregated Wrapper Assets</strong></p>\n<p>For each asset covered in this proposal, a dedicated wrapper contract would accept deposits of the underlying token and mint a corresponding segregated wrapper token (sToken) on a 1:1 basis.</p>\n<p>Examples include the following mappings.</p>\n<p>WETH to sWETH<br>\ncbBTC to scbBTC<br>\nWBTC to sWBTC</p>\n<p>The wrapper naming and symbols are illustrative and can be finalized during implementation. The core requirement is that each wrapper token is always and immediately redeemable for its underlying at a 1:1 rate, similar to the WETH9 implementation and with minimal functionality.</p>\n<p><strong>Aave v3 Listings and Collateral Configuration</strong></p>\n<p>The segregated wrapper assets would then be listed on Aave v3 as collateral and configured as non-borrowable. This configuration ensures that the supplied collateral cannot be borrowed by other users, which is the central property required to prevent rehypothecation.</p>\n<p>From the user perspective, supplying the segregated wrapper asset should function similarly to supplying any other collateral, with the distinction that the supplied balance is not part of the borrowable liquidity pool and is only usable as collateral within its designated E-Mode category.</p>\n<p><strong>E-Mode Configuration and Stablecoin Access</strong></p>\n<p>To preserve existing liquidity and user experience for stablecoin borrowing, the proposal relies on E-Mode categories that allow segregated wrapper collateral to access the existing core stablecoin markets.</p>\n<p>Concretely, the design would introduce dedicated E-Mode categories that include the segregated wrapper collateral assets and the relevant stablecoin borrow assets already listed on the instance.</p>\n<p>This approach allows segregated collateral users to borrow from the existing deep stablecoin reserves.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-user-flow-and-integration-at-a-high-level-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-user-flow-and-integration-at-a-high-level-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>User Flow and Integration at a High Level</h2>\n<p>From a user flow perspective, the mechanism can be summarized as follows.</p>\n<p>A user who opts into the segregated pathway deposits WETH, cbBTC, or WBTC. The corresponding wrapper contract receives the deposited asset and mints a segregated wrapper token (sToken) on a 1:1 basis. The minted sToken is then supplied to Aave on behalf of the user, where it functions exclusively as collateral in E-mode and cannot be borrowed by other participants.</p>\n<p>When the user repays their debt and withdraws collateral, the flow reverses. The wrapper token is withdrawn from Aave, burned in exchange for the underlying, and the underlying token is returned to the user.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-pricing-and-oracle-considerations-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-pricing-and-oracle-considerations-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Pricing and Oracle Considerations</h2>\n<p>The segregated wrapper assets are intended to maintain strict 1:1 parity with their underlying tokens, as they are simple proxy contracts. As a result, the wrapper assets should be priced identically to their underlying assets. This can be achieved by reusing the existing oracle configuration for the underlying assets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-user-experience-and-interface-considerations-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-user-experience-and-interface-considerations-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>User Experience and Interface Considerations</h1>\n<p>The introduction of segregated bluechip collaterals is intended to have minimal impact on the existing Aave user experience and interface. The proposal is designed to extend current functionality rather than alter existing workflows, ensuring that users who prefer pooled markets can continue interacting with the protocol without disruption.</p>\n<p>From a frontend perspective, the segregated wrapper assets (sTokens) would be listed alongside existing assets in the Aave interface, following the same conventions used for other listed tokens. Each wrapper asset would be clearly labeled to reflect its segregated nature, for example sWETH \u2013 Segregated Wrapped Ether, scbBTC \u2013 Segregated Coinbase Wrapped Bitcoin, and sWBTC \u2013 Segregated Wrapped Bitcoin. This naming convention is intended to provide immediate clarity to users regarding the collateral treatment of these assets.</p>\n<p>User interaction flows would remain consistent with current behavior. Supplying segregated collateral, entering the relevant E-Mode, borrowing stablecoins, and managing positions would follow the same steps and interface patterns already familiar to Aave users. The primary difference is the explicit choice at deposit time between supplying the underlying asset into the pooled market or into its segregated counterpart.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-risk-and-benefit-assessment-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-risk-and-benefit-assessment-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk and Benefit Assessment</strong></h1>\n<p>This section outlines the primary benefits and risks associated with the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes, with a focus on protocol level considerations, borrower outcomes, and potential second order effects.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-benefits-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-benefits-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Benefits</h3>\n<p>The proposal enables Aave v3 to directly participate in the growing segment of segregated collateral lending within the broader borrow lend ecosystem. While pooled lending remains dominant, segregated collateral borrowing is exhibiting sustained growth, and supporting this design allows Aave to capture incremental demand rather than ceding this segment to alternative protocols.</p>\n<p>Certainty around liquidity availability materially improves the risk profile of segregated collateral positions. Because collateral is escrowed and never rehypothecated, the protocol can safely support higher borrowing power through better LTV and LT configurations, improving competitiveness for borrowers.</p>\n<p>Guaranteed liquidity availability also ensures that liquidations are not halted or delayed during periods of market volatility due to elevated utilization. This removes a key execution risk present in pooled markets when market approaches full utilization levels and supports more predictable system behavior under stress.</p>\n<p>Lastly, borrowers using segregated collateral also avoid counterparty exposure to other borrowers. Since collateral is not lent out, borrowers are insulated from risks associated with third party defaults or liquidity shortfalls elsewhere in the protocol, resulting in a clearer and more contained risk profile.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-risks-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-risks-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risks</strong></h3>\n<p>The primary risk associated with this proposal relates to potential liquidity migration from pooled markets to segregated markets, particularly for ETH collateral. ETH is a highly utilized market and serves as foundational liquidity supporting large LST and LRT borrowing activity. A meaningful migration of existing ETH supply from pooled markets into segregated configurations could reduce available liquidity for LST and LRT markets and negatively impact overall protocol revenue.</p>\n<p>To mitigate this risk, segregated ETH E-Modes should be introduced with tighter initial supply caps relative to BTC based segregated configurations and monitored closely following deployment. This approach allows governance to observe whether segregated E-Modes are primarily attracting new borrowing demand or instead incentivizing migration of existing positions from pooled markets. Parameter adjustments and caps can then be iteratively refined based on observed usage patterns and their impact on broader market health.</p>\n<p>Overall, while the introduction of segregated bluechip E-Modes introduces a tradeoff between borrowing power, capital efficiency and risk isolation, the proposed design, combined with conservative rollout parameters and active monitoring, allows Aave to explore this design space without materially compromising the stability or profitability of existing pooled markets.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-lt-configuration-considerations-for-segregated-markets-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-lt-configuration-considerations-for-segregated-markets-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>LT Configuration Considerations for Segregated Markets</strong></h1>\n<p>The recommended thresholds are outputs of Chaos Labs VaR-based simulation frameworks that evaluate downside price moves and liquidation feasibility under a range of market conditions, including stressed environments.</p>\n<p>While the specific modeling assumptions and parameterization are subject to refinement and implementation level review, the key calibration intuition is straightforward. In segregated configurations, collateral is escrowed and not rehypothecated, which improves certainty around collateral availability during liquidation events. In addition, collateral is segregated from pooled liquidity dynamics and is not cross margined with broader pool utilization, reducing reliance on external liquidity conditions for liquidation execution. Together, these factors meaningfully reduce liquidation execution risk and limit second-order effects that can arise when collateral is deployed elsewhere in the system.</p>\n<p>As a result, the protocol can support higher borrowing power for these assets relative to pooled configurations while maintaining conservative liquidation safety margins. The proposed LT values are therefore designed to reflect the improved predictability of liquidation execution and collateral accessibility in segregated markets, while still accounting for underlying price volatility, liquidity conditions of borrow assets, and the operational realities of liquidation execution.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-cross-margin-restrictions-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-cross-margin-restrictions-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Cross Margin Restrictions</strong></h1>\n<p>In historical implementations of E-Modes, the protocol fully isolated parameterized debt assets via the E-Mode mask; however, users could hypothetically add non-whitelisted collateral assets to the aggregate position and borrow E-Mode-whitelisted borrowable assets. This led to aggregated position health being dictated by an effectively cross-margined collateral position, complicating the dynamics surrounding factual isolation.</p>\n<p>With the launch of v3.6, there is now a practical path to pure isolation and to strictly preventing cross-margin within the proposed Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes. Specifically, any collateral asset that is not part of a given E-Mode is configured with a maximum LTV of 0 when that E-Mode is active. This ensures that users who already maintain cross-margin positions, where stablecoins are borrowed against a combination of wrapped bluechip and non bluechip collateral, cannot activate the Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode to improve their health factor, which is explicitly designed to operate without cross-margin exposure.</p>\n<p>Operationally, this requires enumerating all collateral assets that are outside the scope of each Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode and assigning them an LTV of 0 within that E-Mode. To avoid excessive table expansion and to maintain readability, these assets are grouped under an \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d category in the specification tables, with the full list disclosed in the section below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61208-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-16\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-16\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assets Configured as \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d</strong></h2>\n<p>The following lists of collateral assets that are configured with LTV0 within each Segregated Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-17\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Segregated ETH Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61208-segregated-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-segregated-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-18\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Segregated BTC Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WBTC, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, CBETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61208-recommendation-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61208-recommendation-19\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Recommendation</h1>\n<p>We recommend the introduction of segregated bluechip stablecoin E-Modes on Aave v3, supported by the listing of dedicated segregated wrapper assets and conservative initial configuration parameters.</p>\n<p>Specifically, we recommend listing segregated wrapper assets (sTokens) for bluechip collateral and enabling their use exclusively within dedicated segregated stablecoin E-Modes.

These E-Modes are designed to enable stablecoin borrowing under a isolated risk parameterization.</p>\n<p>By isolating stablecoin borrowing within dedicated E-Modes, the protocol can offer improved capital efficiency for borrowers without expanding exposure beyond stablecoin debt against bluechip collateral assets. The flexibility introduced in v3.6 allows these E-Mode configurations to be adjusted or deprecated if conditions deteriorate, without impacting the underlying market parameterization or broader risk profile of the base asset markets.</p>\n<p>This approach aligns with a protocol wide risk posture, balancing enhanced borrower efficiency with clearer risk boundaries.</p>\n<p>On Base, where a cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode with matching risk parameters already exists, the proposal modifies the existing E-Mode rather than creating a new one.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-rationale-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-rationale-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>Across major Aave v3 deployments, the primary use case for WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC as collateral is stablecoin borrowing.</p>\n<p>On Ethereum mainnet, more than 95% of the borrowing activity backed by WETH is denominated in stablecoins, primarily USDT and USDC. In addition, the majority of WETH suppliers use WETH as their sole collateral asset and do not opt into cross margin exposure within the Core market.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9b52836abf43a825a8224b666c19654c4f036936.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ma2N6gd8uYcvPur8tryOnqNCsuy.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9b52836abf43a825a8224b666c19654c4f036936.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ma2N6gd8uYcvPur8tryOnqNCsuy\" width=\"620\" height=\"430\"></a></div><br>\nBorrow Against Distribution of WETH - Core Market<p></p>\n<p>A similar pattern is observed for WBTC and cbBTC. Borrowing activity backed by WBTC on Core markets exceeds 95% in stablecoins, while cbBTC exhibits a stablecoin borrowing share above 90%.

By constraining borrowing to stablecoins while maintaining access to deep stablecoin markets for these bluechip collaterals, these E-Modes can support higher capital efficiency for borrowers without introducing additional exposure to reflexive debt.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-cross-margin-restrictions-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-cross-margin-restrictions-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Cross Margin Restrictions</strong></h1>\n<p>In historical implementations of E-Modes, the protocol fully isolated parameterized debt assets via the E-Mode mask; however, users could hypothetically add non-whitelisted collateral assets to the aggregate position and borrow E-Mode-whitelisted borrowable assets. This led to aggregated position health being dictated by an effectively cross-margined collateral position, complicating the dynamics surrounding factual isolation.</p>\n<p>With the launch of v3.6, there is now a practical path to pure isolation and to strictly preventing cross-margin within the proposed Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes. Specifically, any collateral asset that is not part of a given E-Mode is configured with a maximum LTV of 0 when that E-Mode is active. This ensures that users who already maintain cross-margin positions, where stablecoins are borrowed against a combination of wrapped bluechip and non bluechip collateral, cannot activate the Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode to improve their health factor, which is explicitly designed to operate without cross-margin exposure.</p>\n<p>Operationally, this requires enumerating all collateral assets that are outside the scope of each Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode and assigning them an LTV of 0 within that E-Mode. To avoid excessive table expansion and to maintain readability, these assets are grouped under an \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d category in the specification tables, with the full list disclosed in the section below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assets Configured as \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d</strong></h2>\n<p>The following lists of collateral assets that are configured with LTV0 within each Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61209-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>ETH Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WSTETH, WBTC, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Avalanche</strong><br>\nEURC, DAI.e, BTC.b, WAVAX, USDE, SUSDE, AUSD, LINK.e, AAVE.e, WBTC.e, sAVAX</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>CBETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61209-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>BTC Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE, EZETH</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-modification-of-the-existing-cbbtc-e-mode-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-modification-of-the-existing-cbbtc-e-mode-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Modification of the Existing cbBTC E-Mode</strong></h1>\n<p>For all deployments covered in this proposal, new Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes are introduced. The sole exception is the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode on Base, where an equivalent E-Mode already exists with matching risk parameters. In this case, the proposal does not introduce a new E-Mode, but instead modifies the existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode to achieve strict collateral isolation.</p>\n<p>The existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode on Base allows stablecoin borrowing against cbBTC with an LT of 83%. However, collateral assets outside the E-Mode are not currently subject to the LTV0 rule, which permits users to maintain cross-margin positions by combining cbBTC with other collateral assets. Creating a new E-Mode to enforce collateral isolation would require migrating existing user debt, which would introduce unnecessary friction and negatively impact user experience.</p>\n<p>Instead, this proposal preserves the existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode and its parameters, while extending the configuration to include all non E-Mode collateral assets with LTV set to 0. This change enforces true collateral isolation without requiring any migration of existing positions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-impact-on-existing-cross-margin-positions-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-impact-on-existing-cross-margin-positions-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Impact on Existing Cross-Margin Positions</strong></h2>\n<p>For users who currently have the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode active while also supplying additional collateral assets outside of the E-Mode, the following mechanics apply after the modification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All collateral assets outside of the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode will be added to the E-Mode with maximum LTV set to 0.</li>\n<li>These assets will inherit the E-Mode LT of 83%.</li>\n<li>Health Factor may increase, as some of these assets has reserve level LT below 83%.</li>\n<li>Borrowing power will not increase, since the LTV0 rule.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Importantly, while Health Factor may improve, users will not be able to increase borrowing. To fully exit such positions, users must first remove collateral assets with LTV0 before withdrawing cbBTC, which preserves the intended non cross-margin structure of the E-Mode.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-assessment-of-existing-cross-margin-exposure-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-assessment-of-existing-cross-margin-exposure-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assessment of Existing Cross-Margin Exposure</strong></h2>\n<p>An assessment of current positions on Base indicates that the amount of collateral supplied outside of cbBTC in cross-margin positions with an active cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode is limited.</p>\n<p>In aggregate, approximately $3M of non cbBTC collateral is supplied across these positions. Of this amount, roughly $2.7M consists of ETH, which already carries a LT of 83% outside of E-Mode.

These E-Modes are designed to enable stablecoin borrowing under a isolated risk parameterization.</p>\n<p>By isolating stablecoin borrowing within dedicated E-Modes, the protocol can offer improved capital efficiency for borrowers without expanding exposure beyond stablecoin debt against bluechip collateral assets. The flexibility introduced in v3.6 allows these E-Mode configurations to be adjusted or deprecated if conditions deteriorate, without impacting the underlying market parameterization or broader risk profile of the base asset markets.</p>\n<p>This approach aligns with a protocol wide risk posture, balancing enhanced borrower efficiency with clearer risk boundaries.</p>\n<p>On Base, where a cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode with matching risk parameters already exists, the proposal modifies the existing E-Mode rather than creating a new one.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-rationale-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-rationale-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Rationale</h1>\n<p>Across major Aave v3 deployments, the primary use case for WETH, WBTC, and cbBTC as collateral is stablecoin borrowing.</p>\n<p>On Ethereum mainnet, more than 95% of the borrowing activity backed by WETH is denominated in stablecoins, primarily USDT and USDC. In addition, the majority of WETH suppliers use WETH as their sole collateral asset and do not opt into cross margin exposure within the Core market.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9b52836abf43a825a8224b666c19654c4f036936.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/ma2N6gd8uYcvPur8tryOnqNCsuy.png?dl=1\" title=\"image\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/9/9b52836abf43a825a8224b666c19654c4f036936.png\" alt=\"image\" data-base62-sha1=\"ma2N6gd8uYcvPur8tryOnqNCsuy\" width=\"620\" height=\"430\"></a></div><br>\nBorrow Against Distribution of WETH - Core Market<p></p>\n<p>A similar pattern is observed for WBTC and cbBTC. Borrowing activity backed by WBTC on Core markets exceeds 95% in stablecoins, while cbBTC exhibits a stablecoin borrowing share above 90%. These patterns indicate that volatile asset borrowing is not a material driver of demand for bluechip collateral, and that stablecoin access represents the dominant and persistent use case.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/f6ee7b1ae099551c34698149471ae3641f35c5d5.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/zesoQ7MlPfCYf9lfQ1gdLz1NfxP.png?dl=1\" title=\"image (1)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/f6ee7b1ae099551c34698149471ae3641f35c5d5.png\" alt=\"image (1)\" data-base62-sha1=\"zesoQ7MlPfCYf9lfQ1gdLz1NfxP\" width=\"619\" height=\"432\"></a></div><br>\nBorrow Against Distribution of WBTC- Core Market<p></p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/ee8c16e73d5c9e2468ddec32ec8959a2b1d3ceb0.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/y2hMfDXHt5mxm6Yuq0zPR89Xp7y.png?dl=1\" title=\"image (2)\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/e/ee8c16e73d5c9e2468ddec32ec8959a2b1d3ceb0.png\" alt=\"image (2)\" data-base62-sha1=\"y2hMfDXHt5mxm6Yuq0zPR89Xp7y\" width=\"623\" height=\"424\"></a></div><br>\nBorrow Against Distribution of cbBTC- Core Market<p></p>\n<p>Given this observed behavior, introducing isolated stablecoin E-Modes allows the protocol to better align risk parameterization with actual usage. By constraining borrowing to stablecoins while maintaining access to deep stablecoin markets for these bluechip collaterals, these E-Modes can support higher capital efficiency for borrowers without introducing additional exposure to reflexive debt.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-cross-margin-restrictions-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-cross-margin-restrictions-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Cross Margin Restrictions</strong></h1>\n<p>In historical implementations of E-Modes, the protocol fully isolated parameterized debt assets via the E-Mode mask; however, users could hypothetically add non-whitelisted collateral assets to the aggregate position and borrow E-Mode-whitelisted borrowable assets. This led to aggregated position health being dictated by an effectively cross-margined collateral position, complicating the dynamics surrounding factual isolation.</p>\n<p>With the launch of v3.6, there is now a practical path to pure isolation and to strictly preventing cross-margin within the proposed Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes. Specifically, any collateral asset that is not part of a given E-Mode is configured with a maximum LTV of 0 when that E-Mode is active. This ensures that users who already maintain cross-margin positions, where stablecoins are borrowed against a combination of wrapped bluechip and non bluechip collateral, cannot activate the Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode to improve their health factor, which is explicitly designed to operate without cross-margin exposure.</p>\n<p>Operationally, this requires enumerating all collateral assets that are outside the scope of each Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode and assigning them an LTV of 0 within that E-Mode. To avoid excessive table expansion and to maintain readability, these assets are grouped under an \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d category in the specification tables, with the full list disclosed in the section below.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-assets-configured-as-others-ltv0-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assets Configured as \u201cOthers (LTV0)\u201d</strong></h2>\n<p>The following lists of collateral assets that are configured with LTV0 within each Bluechip Stablecoin E-Mode.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61209-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-eth-stablecoin-e-mode-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>ETH Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, WBTC, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, CBBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WSTETH, WBTC, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Avalanche</strong><br>\nEURC, DAI.e, BTC.b, WAVAX, USDE, SUSDE, AUSD, LINK.e, AAVE.e, WBTC.e, sAVAX</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>CBETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61209-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-btc-stablecoin-e-mode-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>BTC Stablecoin E-Mode</strong></h3>\n<p><strong>Ethereum Core</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, WEETH, CBETH, RETH, SDAI, PYUSD, TBTC, USDS, FBTC, EURC, DAI, LUSD, ETHx, AAVE, OSETH, USDE, SUSDE, RSETH, LBTC, FRAX, EBTC, LINK</p>\n<p><strong>Arbitrum</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, USDC.e, TBTC, DAI, WEETH, LINK, RETH, AAVE, ARB</p>\n<p><strong>Base</strong></p>\n<p>WETH, WSTETH, USDBC, CBBTC, EURC, TBTC, WEETH, LBTC, AAVE, EZETH</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61209-modification-of-the-existing-cbbtc-e-mode-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-modification-of-the-existing-cbbtc-e-mode-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Modification of the Existing cbBTC E-Mode</strong></h1>\n<p>For all deployments covered in this proposal, new Bluechip Stablecoin E-Modes are introduced. The sole exception is the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode on Base, where an equivalent E-Mode already exists with matching risk parameters. In this case, the proposal does not introduce a new E-Mode, but instead modifies the existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode to achieve strict collateral isolation.</p>\n<p>The existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode on Base allows stablecoin borrowing against cbBTC with an LT of 83%. However, collateral assets outside the E-Mode are not currently subject to the LTV0 rule, which permits users to maintain cross-margin positions by combining cbBTC with other collateral assets. Creating a new E-Mode to enforce collateral isolation would require migrating existing user debt, which would introduce unnecessary friction and negatively impact user experience.</p>\n<p>Instead, this proposal preserves the existing cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode and its parameters, while extending the configuration to include all non E-Mode collateral assets with LTV set to 0. This change enforces true collateral isolation without requiring any migration of existing positions.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-impact-on-existing-cross-margin-positions-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-impact-on-existing-cross-margin-positions-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Impact on Existing Cross-Margin Positions</strong></h2>\n<p>For users who currently have the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode active while also supplying additional collateral assets outside of the E-Mode, the following mechanics apply after the modification:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>All collateral assets outside of the cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode will be added to the E-Mode with maximum LTV set to 0.</li>\n<li>These assets will inherit the E-Mode LT of 83%.</li>\n<li>Health Factor may increase, as some of these assets has reserve level LT below 83%.</li>\n<li>Borrowing power will not increase, since the LTV0 rule.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Importantly, while Health Factor may improve, users will not be able to increase borrowing. To fully exit such positions, users must first remove collateral assets with LTV0 before withdrawing cbBTC, which preserves the intended non cross-margin structure of the E-Mode.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61209-assessment-of-existing-cross-margin-exposure-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61209-assessment-of-existing-cross-margin-exposure-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Assessment of Existing Cross-Margin Exposure</strong></h2>\n<p>An assessment of current positions on Base indicates that the amount of collateral supplied outside of cbBTC in cross-margin positions with an active cbBTC Stablecoin E-Mode is limited.</p>\n<p>In aggregate, approximately $3M of non cbBTC collateral is supplied across these positions. Of this amount, roughly $2.7M consists of ETH, which already carries a LT of 83% outside of E-Mode.

The objective is to prevent users from expanding leverage during downward oracle deviations and to reduce exposure in a market that is increasingly exhibiting weak peg dynamics and declining usage. As crvUSD is not active as collateral in the relevant configuration, the primary risk surface is not liquidation shortfall driven by impaired collateral exits, but rather the ability for borrowers to increase outstanding crvUSD debt when the oracle marks the liability below par.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61416-crvusd-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61416-crvusd-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>crvUSD</h1>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61416-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61416-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Motivation</h3>\n<p>Over the last 24 hours, the crvUSD/USD oracle price printed a deviation reaching a low of 0.976$.

Summary</h2>\n<p>This proposal introduces <strong>Maxshot AI</strong> to the Aave community as a complementary, value-accretive yield optimization and distribution layer.</p>\n<p>As Maxshot is already integrated with Aave V3 markets across multiple chains, this proposal does <strong>not</strong> request any protocol parameter changes, risk parameter updates, or direct integrations. Instead, it seeks community awareness, feedback, and formal ecosystem recognition of Maxshot as a third-party strategy operator that enhances capital efficiency and user experience for Aave.</p>\n<p>By leveraging AI-driven, non-discretionary agents, Maxshot simplifies access to optimized, omni-chain yield opportunities, with the goal of increasing total value locked (TVL), capital efficiency, and liquidity stickiness across Aave markets.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2. Abstract</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI operates as an intelligent yield optimization layer built on top of Aave and other DeFi protocols. It automatically routes and rebalances capital across chains and markets using deterministic, AI-driven agents to maximize risk-adjusted returns.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to align the Aave community with an existing ecosystem partner that already contributes capital flows into Aave liquidity pools and improves user access to yield opportunities without introducing additional protocol risk.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3. Motivation</h2>\n<p>Aave is a foundational DeFi liquidity protocol with robust risk management, transparent governance, and deployments across multiple networks. While its multi-chain expansion is a core strength, it also introduces structural inefficiencies that create opportunities for complementary, user-layer optimization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-challenges-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-challenges-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Key Challenges</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Fragmentation:</strong> Liquidity is distributed across multiple Aave deployments, requiring users to manually bridge assets, compare rates, and manage positions across chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> Actively managing positions across multiple markets and networks is time-intensive and costly, leading to suboptimal capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Uneven Utilization:</strong> Friction at the user layer can result in idle liquidity and inconsistent utilization across Aave markets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Maxshot\u2019s Role</h3>\n<p>Maxshot AI acts as a non-custodial, intelligent routing and optimization layer on top of Aave, improving capital efficiency and user experience through automated, rules-based yield optimization\u2014without modifying or competing with Aave\u2019s core protocol.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4. Specification: Maxshot Overview</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI Agent Factory, an AI-native, automation-first infrastructure layer designed to build, deploy, and coordinate autonomous agents for on-chain capital optimization.</p>\n<p>At its core, Maxshot provides a standardized framework for creating protocol-aware, risk-constrained AI agents that can observe market conditions, reason over strategy sets, and execute actions across DeFi systems. These agents operate continuously within predefined risk models and governance-aligned parameters, enabling scalable and transparent automation at the infrastructure level.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Key Characteristics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deterministic, Continuous Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Agents operate autonomously and continuously, responding to market changes without manual intervention. All decisions follow transparent, rules-based logic that is auditable and verifiable on-chain, eliminating discretionary risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Full On-Chain Transparency</strong></p>\n<p>Every allocation, rebalance, and performance metric is recorded on-chain and available for real-time community review, enabling ongoing verification of compliance and protocol impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Maxshot enforces a strict separation between optimization logic (Strategy Layer), safety constraints (Risk Layer), and on-chain interactions (Execution Layer). This design ensures that strategy decisions cannot bypass risk controls and that all actions remain auditable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first flagship product built on this framework is <strong>Maxshot Omni Yield Aggregator</strong>, an omni-chain, multi-protocol yield optimization system live across multiple blockchains. Powered by a coordinated network of autonomous agents, the aggregator dynamically allocates capital in real time rather than relying on static strategies or manual rebalancing.</p>\n<p>As the agent factory expands, Maxshot is designed to support new on-chain use cases beyond yield optimization, while maintaining strict alignment with protocol risk frameworks and ecosystem incentives.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>5. Technical Architecture</h2>\n<p>Maxshot follows a protocol-agnostic, modular architecture optimized for transparency, security, and auditability. The system consists of three distinct layers:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Strategy Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Defines optimization logic and allocation objectives by analyzing real-time market data across Aave and other protocols. It generates allocation recommendations but has no execution authority.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-risk-layer-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-risk-layer-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Acts as the system\u2019s safety guardrail, enforcing predefined constraints such as protocol, asset, and chain exposure limits. Any action that violates these rules is automatically blocked and logged for transparency.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-execution-layer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-execution-layer-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Execution Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Handles all on-chain operations, including deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing. Execution is deterministic and fully auditable, and only proceeds after Risk Layer approval.</p>\n<p>This three-layer architecture ensures that strategy optimization, risk management, and execution transparency are never compromised. Each layer operates independently, and no single layer has authority over the entire system. This design reduces the risk of catastrophic failures and ensures that the Aave community retains full visibility and control over Maxshot\u2019s operations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>6. Rationale &amp; Differentiation</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI-native, automation-native financial infrastructure designed to manage and optimize on-chain financial activities.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional yield aggregators that rely on static strategies or manual rebalancing, Maxshot operates as a network of non-discretionary, autonomous agents that continuously evaluate market conditions and execute allocation decisions in real time, strictly within predefined risk constraints and governance-aligned parameters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-core-advantages-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-core-advantages-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Core Advantages</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Omni-chain, Multi-protocol Optimization</strong></p>\n<p>Capital is optimized globally across chains and protocols rather than siloed within a single deployment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Agent-driven (Non-discretionary) Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Deterministic agents execute strategies continuously without human intervention or discretionary decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Strategy, Risk, and Execution</strong></p>\n<p>A modular architecture enforces clear boundaries between optimization logic, risk controls, and execution, enhancing security, transparency, and independent auditability.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This architecture allows Maxshot to function not merely as a yield aggregator, but as a general-purpose AI agent platform, where additional agents (such as risk agents, liquidity routing agents, governance-aware execution agents, and protocol-specific strategy agents) can be composed and deployed over time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>7. Live Deployments &amp; Metrics</h2>\n<p>Maxshot has been live in production since December 2025, and has already attracted meaningful TVL, demonstrating operational readiness and early market validation.</p>\n<p>The platform currently manages approximately $9.8M in total TVL across live deployments, including ~$1.8M in the Omni USDC vault.

Summary</h2>\n<p>This proposal introduces <strong>Maxshot AI</strong> to the Aave community as a complementary, value-accretive yield optimization and distribution layer.</p>\n<p>As Maxshot is already integrated with Aave V3 markets across multiple chains, this proposal does <strong>not</strong> request any protocol parameter changes, risk parameter updates, or direct integrations. Instead, it seeks community awareness, feedback, and formal ecosystem recognition of Maxshot as a third-party strategy operator that enhances capital efficiency and user experience for Aave.</p>\n<p>By leveraging AI-driven, non-discretionary agents, Maxshot simplifies access to optimized, omni-chain yield opportunities, with the goal of increasing total value locked (TVL), capital efficiency, and liquidity stickiness across Aave markets.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-2-abstract-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>2. Abstract</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI operates as an intelligent yield optimization layer built on top of Aave and other DeFi protocols. It automatically routes and rebalances capital across chains and markets using deterministic, AI-driven agents to maximize risk-adjusted returns.</p>\n<p>This proposal aims to align the Aave community with an existing ecosystem partner that already contributes capital flows into Aave liquidity pools and improves user access to yield opportunities without introducing additional protocol risk.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-3-motivation-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>3. Motivation</h2>\n<p>Aave is a foundational DeFi liquidity protocol with robust risk management, transparent governance, and deployments across multiple networks. While its multi-chain expansion is a core strength, it also introduces structural inefficiencies that create opportunities for complementary, user-layer optimization.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-challenges-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-challenges-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Key Challenges</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Fragmentation:</strong> Liquidity is distributed across multiple Aave deployments, requiring users to manually bridge assets, compare rates, and manage positions across chains.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Operational Complexity:</strong> Actively managing positions across multiple markets and networks is time-intensive and costly, leading to suboptimal capital allocation.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Uneven Utilization:</strong> Friction at the user layer can result in idle liquidity and inconsistent utilization across Aave markets.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-maxshots-role-5\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Maxshot\u2019s Role</h3>\n<p>Maxshot AI acts as a non-custodial, intelligent routing and optimization layer on top of Aave, improving capital efficiency and user experience through automated, rules-based yield optimization\u2014without modifying or competing with Aave\u2019s core protocol.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-4-specification-maxshot-overview-6\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>4. Specification: Maxshot Overview</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI Agent Factory, an AI-native, automation-first infrastructure layer designed to build, deploy, and coordinate autonomous agents for on-chain capital optimization.</p>\n<p>At its core, Maxshot provides a standardized framework for creating protocol-aware, risk-constrained AI agents that can observe market conditions, reason over strategy sets, and execute actions across DeFi systems. These agents operate continuously within predefined risk models and governance-aligned parameters, enabling scalable and transparent automation at the infrastructure level.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-key-characteristics-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Key Characteristics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Deterministic, Continuous Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Agents operate autonomously and continuously, responding to market changes without manual intervention. All decisions follow transparent, rules-based logic that is auditable and verifiable on-chain, eliminating discretionary risk.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Full On-Chain Transparency</strong></p>\n<p>Every allocation, rebalance, and performance metric is recorded on-chain and available for real-time community review, enabling ongoing verification of compliance and protocol impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Concerns</strong></p>\n<p>Maxshot enforces a strict separation between optimization logic (Strategy Layer), safety constraints (Risk Layer), and on-chain interactions (Execution Layer). This design ensures that strategy decisions cannot bypass risk controls and that all actions remain auditable.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The first flagship product built on this framework is <strong>Maxshot Omni Yield Aggregator</strong>, an omni-chain, multi-protocol yield optimization system live across multiple blockchains. Powered by a coordinated network of autonomous agents, the aggregator dynamically allocates capital in real time rather than relying on static strategies or manual rebalancing.</p>\n<p>As the agent factory expands, Maxshot is designed to support new on-chain use cases beyond yield optimization, while maintaining strict alignment with protocol risk frameworks and ecosystem incentives.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-5-technical-architecture-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>5. Technical Architecture</h2>\n<p>Maxshot follows a protocol-agnostic, modular architecture optimized for transparency, security, and auditability. The system consists of three distinct layers:</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-strategy-layer-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Strategy Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Defines optimization logic and allocation objectives by analyzing real-time market data across Aave and other protocols. It generates allocation recommendations but has no execution authority.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-risk-layer-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-risk-layer-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Risk Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Acts as the system\u2019s safety guardrail, enforcing predefined constraints such as protocol, asset, and chain exposure limits. Any action that violates these rules is automatically blocked and logged for transparency.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-execution-layer-11\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-execution-layer-11\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Execution Layer</strong></h3>\n<p>Handles all on-chain operations, including deposits, withdrawals, and rebalancing. Execution is deterministic and fully auditable, and only proceeds after Risk Layer approval.</p>\n<p>This three-layer architecture ensures that strategy optimization, risk management, and execution transparency are never compromised. Each layer operates independently, and no single layer has authority over the entire system. This design reduces the risk of catastrophic failures and ensures that the Aave community retains full visibility and control over Maxshot\u2019s operations.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-6-rationale-differentiation-12\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>6. Rationale &amp; Differentiation</h2>\n<p>Maxshot AI is an AI-native, automation-native financial infrastructure designed to manage and optimize on-chain financial activities.</p>\n<p>Unlike traditional yield aggregators that rely on static strategies or manual rebalancing, Maxshot operates as a network of non-discretionary, autonomous agents that continuously evaluate market conditions and execute allocation decisions in real time, strictly within predefined risk constraints and governance-aligned parameters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61188-core-advantages-13\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-core-advantages-13\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Core Advantages</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Omni-chain, Multi-protocol Optimization</strong></p>\n<p>Capital is optimized globally across chains and protocols rather than siloed within a single deployment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Agent-driven (Non-discretionary) Execution</strong></p>\n<p>Deterministic agents execute strategies continuously without human intervention or discretionary decision-making.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separation of Strategy, Risk, and Execution</strong></p>\n<p>A modular architecture enforces clear boundaries between optimization logic, risk controls, and execution, enhancing security, transparency, and independent auditability.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This architecture allows Maxshot to function not merely as a yield aggregator, but as a general-purpose AI agent platform, where additional agents (such as risk agents, liquidity routing agents, governance-aware execution agents, and protocol-specific strategy agents) can be composed and deployed over time.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61188-h-7-live-deployments-metrics-14\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>7. Live Deployments &amp; Metrics</h2>\n<p>Maxshot has been live in production since December 2025, and has already attracted meaningful TVL, demonstrating operational readiness and early market validation.</p>\n<p>The platform currently manages approximately $9.8M in total TVL across live deployments, including ~$1.8M in the Omni USDC vault.

With the addition of Aave Umbrella, the ecosystem\u2019s coverage mechanism, the protocol\u2019s resilience and security have reached new heights.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, it\u2019s natural to ask: how will Aave v4 evolve its interest rate model to compete with such a proven foundation?</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-why-this-matters-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-why-this-matters-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Why This Matters</strong></h3>\n<p>Aave has evolved beyond a standard DeFi lending protocol. It\u2019s already comparable to large banks, and it\u2019s heading toward <strong>$100B+ scale</strong>.  How interest rates are determined now affects more than DAO revenue, it affects the credibility, resilience, and long-term survival of the Aave protocol itself.</p>\n<p>History is clear: interest rate design is not a technical detail. It is one of the primary drivers of systemic failure in lending markets. Over time, lending systems have repeatedly faced a binary choice and both options have proven flawed.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pooled Risk \u2014 <em>The \u201cLehman Brothers\u201d Model</em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this model, safe and risky assets are mixed together. Interest rates fail to reflect true risk, and safe capital silently subsidizes dangerous behavior.</p>\n<p>Lehman Brothers (2008) pursued higher returns by concentrating risk and leverage in opaque asset pools. For a time, this boosted yields. But when market liquidity vanished and asset prices collapsed, the entire structure failed. Risk was hidden, mispriced, and ultimately socialized.</p>\n<p>A modern parallel is Silicon Valley Bank (2023). SVB followed what appeared to be a conservative strategy, holding high-quality, long-duration bonds. But it ignored interest rate risk. When rates rose rapidly, asset values collapsed. Combined with an unstable, uninsured deposit base and instant digital withdrawals, the result was a historic bank run.</p>\n<p>In both cases, the failure was not credit quality alone, it was mispriced interest rate risk.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Fragmented Markets \u2014 <em>The \u201cSilo\u201d Model</em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The opposite approach isolates risk entirely. Assets are placed in separate silos, and rates reflect local conditions accurately but at a cost. Capital becomes trapped and borrowing becomes scarce and expensive even when the system, as a whole, has ample resources.</p>\n<p>This dynamic played out during the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. Countries sharing the same currency experienced wildly divergent interest rates. Fragmented markets drove instability and the system lacked a mechanism to price risk without breaking capital mobility.</p>\n<p>This is why interest rate design in Aave v4 matters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-what-this-analysis-is-intended-to-cover-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-what-this-analysis-is-intended-to-cover-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>What this analysis is intended to cover</strong></h3>\n<p>This analysis examines how these mechanisms interact to determine interest rates in Aave v4. In particular, it considers the <strong>mathematical formulation of rates</strong>, the <strong>impact of liquidity allocation across markets</strong>, and the <strong>architectural guarantees</strong> that isolate risk while enabling capital mobility. By exploring these aspects, the analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of how Aave v4 interest rates function across multiple borrower and lender contexts.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-what-this-analysis-is-not-intended-to-cover-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-what-this-analysis-is-not-intended-to-cover-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>What this analysis is NOT intended to cover</strong></h3>\n<p>This analysis does not evaluate specific asset listings, propose risk parameters, or offer spokes investment guidance. It does not compare Aave v4 rates to other protocols, nor does it address macroeconomic impacts or adoption potential. The scope is intentionally limited to the <strong>design and mechanics of interest rate within Aave v4</strong>, in order to support a focused technical discussion before extending the analysis to broader lending market dynamics.</p>\n<p>By the end, you\u2019ll understand not only how Aave v4 interest rates function, but why I believe this design <strong>represents a structural improvement</strong> in how decentralized credit markets allocate capital.

It does not wait for deposits, borrows, or repayments. Rates derive from global utilization (not isolated per pool) and aggressive borrowers do not subsidize conservative ones. Risk is priced separately via Spoke premiums and exotic collateral does not dilute safe yields. Lenders are compensated based on the real demand for their capital, not on where it happens to reside.</p>\n<p>Unlike previous Aave versions, interest is not a local property of individual pools. It is a global price of liquidity derived from aggregate demand across the system. Hub-level indexes record this history and update automatically over time, before any user interaction occurs.</p>\n<p>Risk is treated separately. Spokes apply premiums and these premiums are paid only by the borrower creating the risk, leaving the base liquidity price and safe lender yield unaffected. Interest and risk are decoupled, transparent, and fully contained, with risk serving as an adjustable overlay.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-12-liquidity-pricing-vs-risk-pricing-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-12-liquidity-pricing-vs-risk-pricing-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>1.2 Liquidity Pricing vs Risk Pricing</strong></h3>\n<p>Aave v4 uses the same two-slope <strong>formula</strong> as Aave v3, but calculates it at the Hub level using <strong>global utilization</strong> instead of per-market isolation. This is a <strong>relocation</strong> of calculation, not a change in curve shape.</p>\n<p>The following table summarizes the differences in interest rates between V3 and v4, This table makes the functional separation between Hub (global liquidity) and Spokes (local risk) immediately clear, showing how Aave v4 resolves the key inefficiencies of V3:</p>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Feature</th>\n<th><strong>Aave V3</strong></th>\n<th><strong>Aave v4</strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Scope of Interest Rates</strong></td>\n<td>Each market computes its own interest rate; rates are local and isolated</td>\n<td>Base rate is computed centrally at the Hub per asset and applied uniformly across all Spokes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Liquidity Tracking</strong></td>\n<td>Utilization tracked independently per market</td>\n<td>Hub tracks global utilization per asset across all Spokes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Risk Expression</strong></td>\n<td>Risk indirectly influences rates; safe deposits may be diluted by risky demand</td>\n<td>Risk premiums are applied locally by Spokes; only risk-taking borrowers pay</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Borrower Experience</strong></td>\n<td>Identical borrowers in different markets can face different rates due to isolation</td>\n<td>All borrowers start from the same Hub base rate; premiums added only when required</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Capital Efficiency</strong></td>\n<td>Fragmented liquidity trapped in isolated pools</td>\n<td>Unified liquidity serving multiple markets without diluting low-risk yield</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Interest Accrual</strong></td>\n<td>Market-specific accrual based on local utilization</td>\n<td>Deterministic, global accrual via Hub-level indexes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Control Over Interest</strong></td>\n<td>Each pool independently computes rates</td>\n<td>Hub is the sole rate authority; Spokes define risk premiums but cannot alter base rates</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-13-deterministic-accrual-and-economic-ordering-8\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-13-deterministic-accrual-and-economic-ordering-8\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>1.3 Deterministic Accrual and Economic Ordering</strong></h3>\n<p>The Hub is the <strong>sole source of economic truth</strong>. It alone computes interest rates, tracks utilization, and advances interest over time. Interest accrues continuously at the Hub, independent of which Spokes are active or which users interact with the system. This makes rates <strong>global, deterministic, and consistent</strong> across all users of a given asset.</p>\n<p>Spokes do not calculate interest or track utilization. Their purpose is to define behavior at the edges: they set which collateral is accepted, borrowing rules, and risk premiums. Any risk is priced <strong>on top of the Hub\u2019s base rate</strong>, leaving the underlying liquidity price and safe lender yield untouched. In other words, the Hub prices capital, and Spokes price risk.</p>\n<p>By separating capital and risk in this way, Aave v4 becomes simpler to reason about. Liquidity is priced at the Hub, risk is priced at the Spoke, interest accrues globally, behavior is expressed locally, capital flows efficiently, and those who create risk are the ones who pay for it.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/516de155dec18e2a30b273090414b18472ce0c58.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/bCm5J7P3Q0JP2WSAhz9OuZ285v2.png?dl=1\" title=\"aave v4 check point\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/516de155dec18e2a30b273090414b18472ce0c58.png\" alt=\"aave v4 check point\" data-base62-sha1=\"bCm5J7P3Q0JP2WSAhz9OuZ285v2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"500\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong><code>LOCKED IN 1</code></strong> There is one base price of liquidity per asset, computed at the Hub<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 2</code></strong> All lenders earn from the same utilization signal<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 3</code></strong> Risk is priced explicitly via Spoke premiums<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 4</code></strong> Interest accrues deterministically, independent of user actions</p>\n<p>What you have not yet seen:</p>\n<p><strong><code>AHEAD 1</code></strong> How utilization maps to rates<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 2</code></strong> The mathematical form of the interest model<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 3</code></strong> How accrual works minute-by-minute<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 4</code></strong> How this architecture behaves under stress</p>\n<p><strong>Next:</strong><br>\nSection 2 explains <strong>how interest rate is actually formed</strong>, first conceptually, then formally.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61370-section-2-interest-rate-mathematics-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-section-2-interest-rate-mathematics-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>SECTION 2 \u2014 INTEREST RATE MATHEMATICS</strong></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-21-global-pricing-local-behavior-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-21-global-pricing-local-behavior-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>2.1 Global Pricing, Local Behavior</strong></h3>\n<p>The Hub aggregates utilization across all Spokes, creating a <strong>global, unified view of demand</strong>. This ensures that the base interest rate reflects real scarcity, not local imbalances or fragmented pools. Lenders earn yield based on total system demand, while borrowers face rates that accurately price liquidity.</p>\n<p>Once utilization is known, it is mapped to an interest rate using a two segment curve. At low utilization levels, the rate increases gradually. This region encourages borrowing and keeps capital productive when liquidity is plentiful. As utilization approaches a critical threshold, the curve steepens sharply.</p>\n<p>The utilization-based interest curve used in Aave v4 has two regions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>A gradual slope below an optimal utilization threshold</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A steep, punitive slope above it</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Below the optimal point, rates exist to encourage borrowing and keep capital productive. Above it, rates exist to defend liquidity buffers and prevent exhaustion. The steep region is intentionally punitive. Extremely high rates are designed to create overwhelming incentives for borrowers to repay and for lenders to supply additional liquidity.

This is where Aave v4\u2019s accrual mechanics \u201cdo the magic\u201d: interest accumulates <strong>continuously via index multiplication</strong>, not through periodic updates to individual balances. Remember, interest rates describe a price but accrual describes how that price is applied as time passes.</p>\n<p><strong>For Borrowers (Compounding)</strong><br>\n<code>New Borrow Index = Old Borrow Index \u00d7 (1 + Borrow Rate \u00d7 \u0394t)</code></p>\n<p><strong>For Lenders (Linear)</strong><br>\n<code>New Liquidity Index = Old Liquidity Index \u00d7 (1 + Borrow Rate \u00d7 Utilization \u00d7 \u0394t)</code></p>\n<p>Both indexes use the same borrow rate, but borrowers compound (interest on interest) while lenders grow linearly (simple interest). This reflects economic reality: borrowers who delay repayment effectively borrow their accrued interest, so they pay interest on interest. Lenders receive simple interest because their capital doesn\u2019t automatically reinvest.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-32-borrow-index-vs-liquidity-index-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-32-borrow-index-vs-liquidity-index-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>3.2 Borrow Index vs Liquidity Index</strong></h3>\n<p>There are <strong>two primary indexes</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Index:</strong> Tracks how supplied assets grow over time as lenders earn yield.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Borrow Index:</strong> Tracks how outstanding debt grows over time as borrowers accrue interest.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both indexes evolve based on the base interest rate produced by system-wide utilization, with additional risk premiums applied where relevant.</p>\n<p>When a user supplies or borrows assets, the protocol records a scaled position rather than a growing balance.

When Bob repays on Day 30, the system doesn\u2019t need to replay history, it simply multiplies his <strong>Debt Shares \u00d7 1.003020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>index is the source of truth</strong>, capturing all growth and friction automatically. When <strong>utilization changes</strong>, the base rate adjusts for future accrual. When a <strong>Spoke updates a risk premium</strong>, that adjustment only affects future interest.</p>\n<p>This design creates a closed economic loop where utilization drives interest rates, rates advance the indexes, and indexes deterministically govern all user outcomes. With the Hub-and-Spoke architecture enforcing these guarantees at the system level, the protocol achieves economic behavior that is both cryptographically transparent and architecturally robust, transforming what could be fragmented cross-chain state into a unified, verifiable source of truth.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-34-why-indexes-instead-of-balance-updates-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-34-why-indexes-instead-of-balance-updates-17\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>3.4 Why Indexes Instead of Balance Updates?</strong></h3>\n<p>At protocol scale, updating user balances directly is just inefficient. Interest accrues continuously, and if every balance were updated as time passed, the system would be forced to touch every account repeatedly even when no one interacts.</p>\n<p>Aave v4 avoids this entirely by shifting where interest is applied. Instead of updating individual balances, the Hub advances shared indexes that represent the cumulative growth of supplied capital and outstanding debt over time. Users do not hold balances that grow on their own, instead, they hold fixed positions whose value is determined by the current index.</p>\n<p><strong>User Balance = User Shares \u00d7 Current Index</strong></p>\n<p>This creates a simple relationship: a user\u2019s balance is the product of their position and the relevant index. When a balance is queried or a transaction is executed, the correct value is derived instantly from the latest index without any historical replay.</p>\n<p>This design also preserves the correct economic asymmetry between lenders and borrowers. Borrowed debt compounds because unpaid interest becomes part of the principal. Supplied capital grows linearly because interest is generated only on the portion of liquidity that is actually borrowed. Separate indexes encode this difference directly, and the gap between them naturally reflects protocol fees and idle capital.</p>\n<p>When interest rates change, the system does not average past and present conditions. The index simply continues to advance using the new rate from that point forward. Earlier growth remains embedded, and future growth layers on top. The result is a single number that fully captures the path of rates over time.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/516de155dec18e2a30b273090414b18472ce0c58.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/bCm5J7P3Q0JP2WSAhz9OuZ285v2.png?dl=1\" title=\"aave v4 check point\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/516de155dec18e2a30b273090414b18472ce0c58.png\" alt=\"aave v4 check point\" data-base62-sha1=\"bCm5J7P3Q0JP2WSAhz9OuZ285v2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"500\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong><code>LOCKED IN 1</code></strong> Borrower debt compounds while lender balances grow linearly.<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 2</code></strong> Interest accrual always happens <strong>before</strong> any user action.<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 3</code></strong> Interest is applied via global indexes instead of updating user balances.<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 4</code></strong> Interest timing games and rate manipulation are structurally impossible.</p>\n<p>What you have not yet seen:</p>\n<p><strong><code>AHEAD 1</code></strong> Why accrual is deterministic and independent of user behavior.<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 2</code></strong> Where Spokes are allowed to intervene and where they are not.<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 3</code></strong> How this design scales without increasing complexity or gas cost.<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 4</code></strong> How these rules are enforced at the contract level.</p>\n<p><strong>Next:</strong><br>\nSection 4 shows <strong>how the Hub/Spoke architecture enforces these guarantees in code</strong>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61370-section-4-interest-rate-architecture-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-section-4-interest-rate-architecture-18\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>SECTION 4 \u2014 INTEREST RATE ARCHITECTURE</strong></h2>\n<p>Aave v4 separates economic state from behavioral logic.

In earlier protocol architectures, risk was handled in a binary fashion: a collateral type was either allowed or disallowed. Once admitted, all assets largely shared the same interest rate environment. This approach produced blunt outcomes. If risky collateral was excluded entirely, some borrowers lost access to liquidity. If risky collateral was included, the risk was implicitly spread across all users, regardless of their actual exposure.</p>\n<p>Aave v4 replaces this blunt model with granular and transparent risk pricing. The base interest rate reflects system-wide demand for liquidity, while risk premiums are applied only to borrowers who introduce incremental risk. By keeping liquidity unified and pricing risk directly, Aave v4 ensures that risk becomes a visible, measurable input rather than a hidden externality. Utilization determines the base price, risk determines the premium, and any losses remain with the positions that actually generate the risk.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-52-individual-risk-vectors-40\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-52-individual-risk-vectors-40\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>5.2 Individual Risk Vectors</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Risk Vector</th>\n<th>v3 Behavior</th>\n<th>v4 Isolation Mechanism</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Bad Collateral</td>\n<td>Affects entire pool\u2019s risk profile</td>\n<td>Spoke-level: Only borrowers using that collateral pay premium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Liquidation Cascade</td>\n<td>Can drain pool liquidity</td>\n<td>Hub maintains global liquidity buffer; Spoke pauses independently</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oracle Failure</td>\n<td>Freezes entire market</td>\n<td>Affected Spoke freezes; other Spokes continue operating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Smart Contract Bug</td>\n<td>Compromises all reserves</td>\n<td>Bug isolated to affected Spoke; Hub remains intact</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-53-who-bears-what-risk-41\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-53-who-bears-what-risk-41\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>5.3 Who Bears What Risk</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Risk Type</th>\n<th>Who Bears It</th>\n<th>Mitigation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Collateral volatility</td>\n<td>Borrower using that collateral</td>\n<td>Risk premium + liquidation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spoke smart contract bug</td>\n<td>Users of that Spoke</td>\n<td>Isolated contract scope</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oracle manipulation</td>\n<td>Spoke relying on oracle</td>\n<td>Multiple oracle sources + delays</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deficit (bad debt)</td>\n<td>Protocol reserves \u2192 Lenders (last resort)</td>\n<td>Safety module + insurance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hub smart contract bug</td>\n<td>Systemic (all users)</td>\n<td>Extensive audits + formal verification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-54-non-negotiable-rules-42\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-54-non-negotiable-rules-42\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>5.4 Non-Negotiable Rules</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Rule</th>\n<th>Never Allowed</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Base rate</td>\n<td>Cannot be influenced by individual collateral risk or Spoke premiums.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Premiums</td>\n<td>Cannot be socialized across unrelated users or Spokes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Losses</td>\n<td>Cannot be spread outside the originating risk compartment.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Index math</td>\n<td>Cannot be altered by Spoke-level risk adjustments.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Safety</td>\n<td>Cannot depend on transaction ordering; must remain deterministic.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"p-61370-section-6-strategic-implications-43\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-section-6-strategic-implications-43\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>SECTION 6 \u2014 STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS</strong></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-61-capital-efficiency-gains-44\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-61-capital-efficiency-gains-44\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>6.1 Capital Efficiency Gains</strong></h3>\n<p>Aave v4\u2019s interest rate architecture is more than a technical upgrade; it reshapes how capital is priced and allocated.

With the addition of Aave Umbrella, the ecosystem\u2019s coverage mechanism, the protocol\u2019s resilience and security have reached new heights.</p>\n<p>Against this backdrop, it\u2019s natural to ask: how will Aave v4 evolve its interest rate model to compete with such a proven foundation?</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-why-this-matters-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-why-this-matters-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Why This Matters</strong></h3>\n<p>Aave has evolved beyond a standard DeFi lending protocol. It\u2019s already comparable to large banks, and it\u2019s heading toward <strong>$100B+ scale</strong>.  How interest rates are determined now affects more than DAO revenue, it affects the credibility, resilience, and long-term survival of the Aave protocol itself.</p>\n<p>History is clear: interest rate design is not a technical detail. It is one of the primary drivers of systemic failure in lending markets. Over time, lending systems have repeatedly faced a binary choice and both options have proven flawed.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pooled Risk \u2014 <em>The \u201cLehman Brothers\u201d Model</em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>In this model, safe and risky assets are mixed together. Interest rates fail to reflect true risk, and safe capital silently subsidizes dangerous behavior.</p>\n<p>Lehman Brothers (2008) pursued higher returns by concentrating risk and leverage in opaque asset pools. For a time, this boosted yields. But when market liquidity vanished and asset prices collapsed, the entire structure failed. Risk was hidden, mispriced, and ultimately socialized.</p>\n<p>A modern parallel is Silicon Valley Bank (2023). SVB followed what appeared to be a conservative strategy, holding high-quality, long-duration bonds. But it ignored interest rate risk. When rates rose rapidly, asset values collapsed. Combined with an unstable, uninsured deposit base and instant digital withdrawals, the result was a historic bank run.</p>\n<p>In both cases, the failure was not credit quality alone, it was mispriced interest rate risk.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong>Fragmented Markets \u2014 <em>The \u201cSilo\u201d Model</em></strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The opposite approach isolates risk entirely. Assets are placed in separate silos, and rates reflect local conditions accurately but at a cost. Capital becomes trapped and borrowing becomes scarce and expensive even when the system, as a whole, has ample resources.</p>\n<p>This dynamic played out during the Eurozone sovereign debt crisis. Countries sharing the same currency experienced wildly divergent interest rates. Fragmented markets drove instability and the system lacked a mechanism to price risk without breaking capital mobility.</p>\n<p>This is why interest rate design in Aave v4 matters.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-what-this-analysis-is-intended-to-cover-3\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-what-this-analysis-is-intended-to-cover-3\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>What this analysis is intended to cover</strong></h3>\n<p>This analysis examines how these mechanisms interact to determine interest rates in Aave v4. In particular, it considers the <strong>mathematical formulation of rates</strong>, the <strong>impact of liquidity allocation across markets</strong>, and the <strong>architectural guarantees</strong> that isolate risk while enabling capital mobility. By exploring these aspects, the analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of how Aave v4 interest rates function across multiple borrower and lender contexts.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-what-this-analysis-is-not-intended-to-cover-4\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-what-this-analysis-is-not-intended-to-cover-4\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>What this analysis is NOT intended to cover</strong></h3>\n<p>This analysis does not evaluate specific asset listings, propose risk parameters, or offer spokes investment guidance.

It does not wait for deposits, borrows, or repayments. Rates derive from global utilization (not isolated per pool) and aggressive borrowers do not subsidize conservative ones. Risk is priced separately via Spoke premiums and exotic collateral does not dilute safe yields. Lenders are compensated based on the real demand for their capital, not on where it happens to reside.</p>\n<p>Unlike previous Aave versions, interest is not a local property of individual pools. It is a global price of liquidity derived from aggregate demand across the system. Hub-level indexes record this history and update automatically over time, before any user interaction occurs.</p>\n<p>Risk is treated separately. Spokes apply premiums and these premiums are paid only by the borrower creating the risk, leaving the base liquidity price and safe lender yield unaffected. Interest and risk are decoupled, transparent, and fully contained, with risk serving as an adjustable overlay.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-12-liquidity-pricing-vs-risk-pricing-7\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-12-liquidity-pricing-vs-risk-pricing-7\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>1.2 Liquidity Pricing vs Risk Pricing</strong></h3>\n<p>Aave v4 uses the same two-slope <strong>formula</strong> as Aave v3, but calculates it at the Hub level using <strong>global utilization</strong> instead of per-market isolation.

It alone computes interest rates, tracks utilization, and advances interest over time. Interest accrues continuously at the Hub, independent of which Spokes are active or which users interact with the system. This makes rates <strong>global, deterministic, and consistent</strong> across all users of a given asset.</p>\n<p>Spokes do not calculate interest or track utilization. Their purpose is to define behavior at the edges: they set which collateral is accepted, borrowing rules, and risk premiums. Any risk is priced <strong>on top of the Hub\u2019s base rate</strong>, leaving the underlying liquidity price and safe lender yield untouched. In other words, the Hub prices capital, and Spokes price risk.</p>\n<p>By separating capital and risk in this way, Aave v4 becomes simpler to reason about. Liquidity is priced at the Hub, risk is priced at the Spoke, interest accrues globally, behavior is expressed locally, capital flows efficiently, and those who create risk are the ones who pay for it.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/516de155dec18e2a30b273090414b18472ce0c58.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/bCm5J7P3Q0JP2WSAhz9OuZ285v2.png?dl=1\" title=\"aave v4 check point\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/516de155dec18e2a30b273090414b18472ce0c58.png\" alt=\"aave v4 check point\" data-base62-sha1=\"bCm5J7P3Q0JP2WSAhz9OuZ285v2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"500\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong><code>LOCKED IN 1</code></strong> There is one base price of liquidity per asset, computed at the Hub<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 2</code></strong> All lenders earn from the same utilization signal<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 3</code></strong> Risk is priced explicitly via Spoke premiums<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 4</code></strong> Interest accrues deterministically, independent of user actions</p>\n<p>What you have not yet seen:</p>\n<p><strong><code>AHEAD 1</code></strong> How utilization maps to rates<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 2</code></strong> The mathematical form of the interest model<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 3</code></strong> How accrual works minute-by-minute<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 4</code></strong> How this architecture behaves under stress</p>\n<p><strong>Next:</strong><br>\nSection 2 explains <strong>how interest rate is actually formed</strong>, first conceptually, then formally.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61370-section-2-interest-rate-mathematics-9\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-section-2-interest-rate-mathematics-9\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>SECTION 2 \u2014 INTEREST RATE MATHEMATICS</strong></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-21-global-pricing-local-behavior-10\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-21-global-pricing-local-behavior-10\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>2.1 Global Pricing, Local Behavior</strong></h3>\n<p>The Hub aggregates utilization across all Spokes, creating a <strong>global, unified view of demand</strong>.

This is where Aave v4\u2019s accrual mechanics \u201cdo the magic\u201d: interest accumulates <strong>continuously via index multiplication</strong>, not through periodic updates to individual balances. Remember, interest rates describe a price but accrual describes how that price is applied as time passes.</p>\n<p><strong>For Borrowers (Compounding)</strong><br>\n<code>New Borrow Index = Old Borrow Index \u00d7 (1 + Borrow Rate \u00d7 \u0394t)</code></p>\n<p><strong>For Lenders (Linear)</strong><br>\n<code>New Liquidity Index = Old Liquidity Index \u00d7 (1 + Borrow Rate \u00d7 Utilization \u00d7 \u0394t)</code></p>\n<p>Both indexes use the same borrow rate, but borrowers compound (interest on interest) while lenders grow linearly (simple interest). This reflects economic reality: borrowers who delay repayment effectively borrow their accrued interest, so they pay interest on interest. Lenders receive simple interest because their capital doesn\u2019t automatically reinvest.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-32-borrow-index-vs-liquidity-index-15\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-32-borrow-index-vs-liquidity-index-15\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>3.2 Borrow Index vs Liquidity Index</strong></h3>\n<p>There are <strong>two primary indexes</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Liquidity Index:</strong> Tracks how supplied assets grow over time as lenders earn yield.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Borrow Index:</strong> Tracks how outstanding debt grows over time as borrowers accrue interest.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Both indexes evolve based on the base interest rate produced by system-wide utilization, with additional risk premiums applied where relevant.</p>\n<p>When a user supplies or borrows assets, the protocol records a scaled position rather than a growing balance.

When Bob repays on Day 30, the system doesn\u2019t need to replay history, it simply multiplies his <strong>Debt Shares \u00d7 1.003020</strong>.</p>\n<p>The <strong>index is the source of truth</strong>, capturing all growth and friction automatically. When <strong>utilization changes</strong>, the base rate adjusts for future accrual. When a <strong>Spoke updates a risk premium</strong>, that adjustment only affects future interest.</p>\n<p>This design creates a closed economic loop where utilization drives interest rates, rates advance the indexes, and indexes deterministically govern all user outcomes. With the Hub-and-Spoke architecture enforcing these guarantees at the system level, the protocol achieves economic behavior that is both cryptographically transparent and architecturally robust, transforming what could be fragmented cross-chain state into a unified, verifiable source of truth.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-34-why-indexes-instead-of-balance-updates-17\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-34-why-indexes-instead-of-balance-updates-17\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>3.4 Why Indexes Instead of Balance Updates?</strong></h3>\n<p>At protocol scale, updating user balances directly is just inefficient. Interest accrues continuously, and if every balance were updated as time passed, the system would be forced to touch every account repeatedly even when no one interacts.</p>\n<p>Aave v4 avoids this entirely by shifting where interest is applied. Instead of updating individual balances, the Hub advances shared indexes that represent the cumulative growth of supplied capital and outstanding debt over time. Users do not hold balances that grow on their own, instead, they hold fixed positions whose value is determined by the current index.</p>\n<p><strong>User Balance = User Shares \u00d7 Current Index</strong></p>\n<p>This creates a simple relationship: a user\u2019s balance is the product of their position and the relevant index. When a balance is queried or a transaction is executed, the correct value is derived instantly from the latest index without any historical replay.</p>\n<p>This design also preserves the correct economic asymmetry between lenders and borrowers. Borrowed debt compounds because unpaid interest becomes part of the principal. Supplied capital grows linearly because interest is generated only on the portion of liquidity that is actually borrowed. Separate indexes encode this difference directly, and the gap between them naturally reflects protocol fees and idle capital.</p>\n<p>When interest rates change, the system does not average past and present conditions. The index simply continues to advance using the new rate from that point forward. Earlier growth remains embedded, and future growth layers on top. The result is a single number that fully captures the path of rates over time.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/516de155dec18e2a30b273090414b18472ce0c58.png\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/bCm5J7P3Q0JP2WSAhz9OuZ285v2.png?dl=1\" title=\"aave v4 check point\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/5/516de155dec18e2a30b273090414b18472ce0c58.png\" alt=\"aave v4 check point\" data-base62-sha1=\"bCm5J7P3Q0JP2WSAhz9OuZ285v2\" width=\"1500\" height=\"500\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p><strong><code>LOCKED IN 1</code></strong> Borrower debt compounds while lender balances grow linearly.<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 2</code></strong> Interest accrual always happens <strong>before</strong> any user action.<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 3</code></strong> Interest is applied via global indexes instead of updating user balances.<br>\n<strong><code>LOCKED IN 4</code></strong> Interest timing games and rate manipulation are structurally impossible.</p>\n<p>What you have not yet seen:</p>\n<p><strong><code>AHEAD 1</code></strong> Why accrual is deterministic and independent of user behavior.<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 2</code></strong> Where Spokes are allowed to intervene and where they are not.<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 3</code></strong> How this design scales without increasing complexity or gas cost.<br>\n<strong><code>AHEAD 4</code></strong> How these rules are enforced at the contract level.</p>\n<p><strong>Next:</strong><br>\nSection 4 shows <strong>how the Hub/Spoke architecture enforces these guarantees in code</strong>.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61370-section-4-interest-rate-architecture-18\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-section-4-interest-rate-architecture-18\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>SECTION 4 \u2014 INTEREST RATE ARCHITECTURE</strong></h2>\n<p>Aave v4 separates economic state from behavioral logic.

In earlier protocol architectures, risk was handled in a binary fashion: a collateral type was either allowed or disallowed. Once admitted, all assets largely shared the same interest rate environment. This approach produced blunt outcomes. If risky collateral was excluded entirely, some borrowers lost access to liquidity. If risky collateral was included, the risk was implicitly spread across all users, regardless of their actual exposure.</p>\n<p>Aave v4 replaces this blunt model with granular and transparent risk pricing. The base interest rate reflects system-wide demand for liquidity, while risk premiums are applied only to borrowers who introduce incremental risk. By keeping liquidity unified and pricing risk directly, Aave v4 ensures that risk becomes a visible, measurable input rather than a hidden externality. Utilization determines the base price, risk determines the premium, and any losses remain with the positions that actually generate the risk.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-52-individual-risk-vectors-40\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-52-individual-risk-vectors-40\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>5.2 Individual Risk Vectors</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Risk Vector</th>\n<th>v3 Behavior</th>\n<th>v4 Isolation Mechanism</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Bad Collateral</td>\n<td>Affects entire pool\u2019s risk profile</td>\n<td>Spoke-level: Only borrowers using that collateral pay premium</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Liquidation Cascade</td>\n<td>Can drain pool liquidity</td>\n<td>Hub maintains global liquidity buffer; Spoke pauses independently</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oracle Failure</td>\n<td>Freezes entire market</td>\n<td>Affected Spoke freezes; other Spokes continue operating</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Smart Contract Bug</td>\n<td>Compromises all reserves</td>\n<td>Bug isolated to affected Spoke; Hub remains intact</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-53-who-bears-what-risk-41\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-53-who-bears-what-risk-41\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>5.3 Who Bears What Risk</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Risk Type</th>\n<th>Who Bears It</th>\n<th>Mitigation</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Collateral volatility</td>\n<td>Borrower using that collateral</td>\n<td>Risk premium + liquidation</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Spoke smart contract bug</td>\n<td>Users of that Spoke</td>\n<td>Isolated contract scope</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Oracle manipulation</td>\n<td>Spoke relying on oracle</td>\n<td>Multiple oracle sources + delays</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Deficit (bad debt)</td>\n<td>Protocol reserves \u2192 Lenders (last resort)</td>\n<td>Safety module + insurance</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hub smart contract bug</td>\n<td>Systemic (all users)</td>\n<td>Extensive audits + formal verification</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-54-non-negotiable-rules-42\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-54-non-negotiable-rules-42\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>5.4 Non-Negotiable Rules</strong></h3>\n<div class=\"md-table\">\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Rule</th>\n<th>Never Allowed</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Base rate</td>\n<td>Cannot be influenced by individual collateral risk or Spoke premiums.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Premiums</td>\n<td>Cannot be socialized across unrelated users or Spokes.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Losses</td>\n<td>Cannot be spread outside the originating risk compartment.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Index math</td>\n<td>Cannot be altered by Spoke-level risk adjustments.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Safety</td>\n<td>Cannot depend on transaction ordering; must remain deterministic.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div><h2><a name=\"p-61370-section-6-strategic-implications-43\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-section-6-strategic-implications-43\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>SECTION 6 \u2014 STRATEGIC IMPLICATIONS</strong></h2>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61370-h-61-capital-efficiency-gains-44\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-h-61-capital-efficiency-gains-44\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>6.1 Capital Efficiency Gains</strong></h3>\n<p>Aave v4\u2019s interest rate architecture is more than a technical upgrade; it reshapes how capital is priced and allocated.

This means tokenized receivables, trade finance instruments, inventory financing, and real estate lending can coexist and be priced accurately against global supply and demand for liquidity.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61370-section-7-decision-framework-46\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-section-7-decision-framework-46\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>SECTION 7 \u2014 DECISION FRAMEWORK</strong></h2>\n<p>Every participant in Aave v4 makes decisions in response to interest-rate\u2013derived price signals.

This architectural separation transforms lending from a zero-sum game of fragmented pools into a composable system where innovation scales without compromising safety. This positions Aave v4 not as a lending protocol among many, but as foundational infrastructure for how decentralized credit markets will price and allocate capital at scale.</p>\n<h2><a name=\"p-61370-disclaimer-51\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61370-disclaimer-51\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>Disclaimer</strong></h2>\n<p>I was not compensated by any third party for publishing this research.

By replaying real liquidation events from Aave v3 with different v4 settings, we demonstrate that simple parameter choices directly affect the amount of debt repaid, the attractiveness of liquidations to liquidators, and the protocol\u2019s revenue, including from SVR.</p>\n<p>Settings that favor borrowers result in smaller, less aggressive liquidations. This improves the experience for users whose positions are liquidated, but it also reduces incentives for liquidators and diminishes the surplus the protocol can capture. While this approach may perform well under stable market conditions, it can make liquidations less reliable during periods of high volatility.</p>\n<p>In contrast, settings that prioritise liquidation efficiency make liquidations more appealing to execute, even in stressed markets. These configurations result in larger liquidations and higher protocol revenue, but they also mean more forceful action against borrowers once their positions become undercollateralized.</p>\n<p>The main takeaway is that there is no single \u201cright\u201d liquidation configuration. Aave v4 enables the DAO to tailor liquidation behavior at the spoke level by adjusting parameters. This flexibility enables balancing user experience, system safety, and protocol sustainability in ways that align with the risk profile and objectives of each spoke.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61434-disclosure-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61434-disclosure-19\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclosure</h1>\n<p>The full methodology, simulation code, and dataset are available upon request.</p>\n<p>TokenLogic did not receive any payment for this post.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61434-copyright-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61434-copyright-20\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Copyright</h1>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived via <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CC0</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/v4-spoke-liquidation-parameters-impact-on-revenue/23993\">Read full topic</a></p>\n          ",

By replaying real liquidation events from Aave v3 with different v4 settings, we demonstrate that simple parameter choices directly affect the amount of debt repaid, the attractiveness of liquidations to liquidators, and the protocol\u2019s revenue, including from SVR.</p>\n<p>Settings that favor borrowers result in smaller, less aggressive liquidations. This improves the experience for users whose positions are liquidated, but it also reduces incentives for liquidators and diminishes the surplus the protocol can capture. While this approach may perform well under stable market conditions, it can make liquidations less reliable during periods of high volatility.</p>\n<p>In contrast, settings that prioritise liquidation efficiency make liquidations more appealing to execute, even in stressed markets. These configurations result in larger liquidations and higher protocol revenue, but they also mean more forceful action against borrowers once their positions become undercollateralized.</p>\n<p>The main takeaway is that there is no single \u201cright\u201d liquidation configuration. Aave v4 enables the DAO to tailor liquidation behavior at the spoke level by adjusting parameters. This flexibility enables balancing user experience, system safety, and protocol sustainability in ways that align with the risk profile and objectives of each spoke.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61434-disclosure-19\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61434-disclosure-19\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Disclosure</h1>\n<p>The full methodology, simulation code, and dataset are available upon request.</p>\n<p>TokenLogic did not receive any payment for this post.</p>\n<h1><a name=\"p-61434-copyright-20\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61434-copyright-20\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a>Copyright</h1>\n<p>Copyright and related rights waived via <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow ugc\">CC0</a>.</p>\n            <p><small>4 posts - 4 participants</small></p>\n            <p><a href=\"https://governance.aave.com/t/v4-spoke-liquidation-parameters-impact-on-revenue/23993\">Read full topic</a></p>\n          ",

A convergence of geopolitical escalation in the Middle East, a temporary United States government funding lapse, and a historic drawdown in precious metals such as gold or silver cascaded into the crypto markets during thin weekend trading hours. Bitcoin fell from $84,000 to below $77,000 and Ethereum dropped to $2,300. Within hours, more than $2.2 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated across centralized and decentralized venues.</p>\n<p><strong>Aave v3 absorbed the shock and by any conventional risk metric, the system performed as designed. PERFECT.</strong></p>\n<p>Over <strong>$140 million</strong> in liquidations were processed, primarily in Stables, ETH, WBTC, and wstETH markets, without triggering protocol wide insolvency. With Net of liquidation fees, Smart Value Recapture revenue, and minor isolated deficits, the protocol ended the week profitable by repaying <strong>$147 million of user debt</strong> and distributing <strong>$7.14 million in liquidation bonuses</strong> according to Chaos Labs.</p>\n<p>And yet, beneath this apparent success lay a more subtle pathology. Hundreds of positions did not liquidate and they did not recover either. Instead, they hovered in a narrow band just above the liquidation threshold, with <strong>health factors between 0.95 and 1.0,</strong> some for hours, some for days.</p>\n<p>Today, I took a look at Chaos Labs amazing Dashboard and I wanted to write this small blog about it. I am arguing that this liminal state is not an edge case but a structural feature of modern DeFi lending markets, because of that, it requires its own analytical framework and its own protocol response especially as Aave is aiming at $100B+.</p>\n<p>I call this framework \u201c<strong>Zombie Positions\u201d</strong>.</p>\n<p>Chaos Labs data shows that this tail is numerically large but balance-light, suggesting the dominant unresolved risk is behavioral persistence near HF \u2248 1.0, not hidden insolvency. These positions generated no liquidation revenue, no interest upside, and no productive deployment of collateral. They demanded constant oracle updates, continuous health checks, and governance attention.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61397-the-anatomy-of-a-zombie-position-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61397-the-anatomy-of-a-zombie-position-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>The Anatomy of a Zombie Position</strong></h3>\n<p>Aave\u2019s health factor is simple math: <strong>Collateral value multiplied by the liquidation threshold, divided by the debt value</strong>.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/0/04c072200ef141c446309b9ff658a1f6002d2c64.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/G2dPDqUaJAt0HqMObLPI1NghOk.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Zombie Wallets\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/0/04c072200ef141c446309b9ff658a1f6002d2c64.jpeg\" alt=\"Zombie Wallets\" data-base62-sha1=\"G2dPDqUaJAt0HqMObLPI1NghOk\" width=\"1920\" height=\"976\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>But between 0.95 and 1.0 lies a dead zone. Borrowers can\u2019t withdraw collateral (health factor too low). They can\u2019t add leverage (too risky). Many lack the cash to repay.

A convergence of geopolitical escalation in the Middle East, a temporary United States government funding lapse, and a historic drawdown in precious metals such as gold or silver cascaded into the crypto markets during thin weekend trading hours. Bitcoin fell from $84,000 to below $77,000 and Ethereum dropped to $2,300. Within hours, more than $2.2 billion in leveraged positions were liquidated across centralized and decentralized venues.</p>\n<p><strong>Aave v3 absorbed the shock and by any conventional risk metric, the system performed as designed. PERFECT.</strong></p>\n<p>Over <strong>$140 million</strong> in liquidations were processed, primarily in Stables, ETH, WBTC, and wstETH markets, without triggering protocol wide insolvency. With Net of liquidation fees, Smart Value Recapture revenue, and minor isolated deficits, the protocol ended the week profitable by repaying <strong>$147 million of user debt</strong> and distributing <strong>$7.14 million in liquidation bonuses</strong> according to Chaos Labs.</p>\n<p>And yet, beneath this apparent success lay a more subtle pathology. Hundreds of positions did not liquidate and they did not recover either. Instead, they hovered in a narrow band just above the liquidation threshold, with <strong>health factors between 0.95 and 1.0,</strong> some for hours, some for days.</p>\n<p>Today, I took a look at Chaos Labs amazing Dashboard and I wanted to write this small blog about it. I am arguing that this liminal state is not an edge case but a structural feature of modern DeFi lending markets, because of that, it requires its own analytical framework and its own protocol response especially as Aave is aiming at $100B+.</p>\n<p>I call this framework \u201c<strong>Zombie Positions\u201d</strong>.</p>\n<p>Chaos Labs data shows that this tail is numerically large but balance-light, suggesting the dominant unresolved risk is behavioral persistence near HF \u2248 1.0, not hidden insolvency. These positions generated no liquidation revenue, no interest upside, and no productive deployment of collateral. They demanded constant oracle updates, continuous health checks, and governance attention.</p>\n<h3><a name=\"p-61397-the-anatomy-of-a-zombie-position-2\" class=\"anchor\" href=\"https://governance.aave.com#p-61397-the-anatomy-of-a-zombie-position-2\" aria-label=\"Heading link\"></a><strong>The Anatomy of a Zombie Position</strong></h3>\n<p>Aave\u2019s health factor is simple math: <strong>Collateral value multiplied by the liquidation threshold, divided by the debt value</strong>.</p>\n<p></p><div class=\"lightbox-wrapper\"><a class=\"lightbox\" href=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/0/04c072200ef141c446309b9ff658a1f6002d2c64.jpeg\" data-download-href=\"/uploads/short-url/G2dPDqUaJAt0HqMObLPI1NghOk.jpeg?dl=1\" title=\"Zombie Wallets\"><img src=\"https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex013/uploads/aave/original/2X/0/04c072200ef141c446309b9ff658a1f6002d2c64.jpeg\" alt=\"Zombie Wallets\" data-base62-sha1=\"G2dPDqUaJAt0HqMObLPI1NghOk\" width=\"1920\" height=\"976\"></a></div><p></p>\n<p>But between 0.95 and 1.0 lies a dead zone.
